<h2 id="c1">I. HOW WOOLLY BILLY CAME TO BRINE&rsquo;S RIP</h2>
<h3 class="generic">I</h3>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s mother was a big cross-bred bitch,
half Newfoundland and half bloodhound,
belonging to Black Saunders, one of the hands
at the Brine&rsquo;s Rip Mills. As the mills were
always busy, Saunders was always busy, and
it was no place for a dog to be around, among
the screeching saws, the thumping, wet logs,
and the spurting sawdust. So the big bitch,
with fiery energy thrilling her veins and
sinews and the restraint of a master&rsquo;s hand
seldom exercised upon her, practically ran
wild.</p>
<p>Hunting on her own account in the deep
wilderness which surrounded Brine&rsquo;s Rip
Settlement, she became a deadly menace to
every wild thing less formidable than a bear
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
or a bull moose, till at last, in the early prime
of her adventurous career, she was shot by an
angry game warden for her depredations
among the deer and the young caribou.</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s father was a splendid and pedigreed
specimen of the old English sheep-dog. From
a litter of puppies of this uncommon parentage,
Tug Blackstock, the Deputy Sheriff of
Nipsiwaska County, chose out the one that
seemed to him the likeliest, paid Black
Saunders a sovereign for him, and named him
Jim. To Tug Blackstock, for some unfathomed
reason, the name of &ldquo;Jim&rdquo; stood for
self-contained efficiency.</p>
<p>It was efficiency, in chief, that Tug Blackstock,
as Deputy Sheriff, was after. He had
been reading, in a stray magazine with torn
cover and much-thumbed pages, an account of
the wonderful doings of the trained police
dogs of Paris. The story had fired his imagination
and excited his envy.</p>
<p>There was a lawless element in some of the
outlying corners of Nipsiwaska County, with
a larger element of yet more audacious lawlessness
beyond the county line from which
to recruit. Throughout the wide and mostly
wilderness expanse of Nipsiwaska County the
responsibility for law and order rested almost
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
solely upon the shoulders of Tug Blackstock.
His chief, the Sheriff, a prosperous shopkeeper
who owed his appointment to his
political pull, knew little and thought less of
the duties of his office.</p>
<p>As soon as Jim was old enough to have an
interest beyond his breakfast and the worrying
of his rag ball, Tug Blackstock set about
his training. It was a matter that could not
be hurried. Tug had much work to do and
Jim, as behoved a growing puppy, had a deal
of play to get through in the course of each
twenty-four hours. Then so hard was the
learning, so easy, alas! the forgetting. Tug
Blackstock was kind to all creatures but timber
thieves and other evil-doers of like kidney. He
was patient, with the long patience of the
forest. But he had a will like the granite of
old Bald Face.</p>
<p>Jim was quick of wit, willing to learn,
intent to please his master. But it was hard
for him to concentrate. It was hard to keep
his mind off cats, and squirrels, the worrying
of old boots, and other doggish frivolities.
Hence, at times, some painful misunderstandings
between teacher and pupil. In the
main, however, the education of Jim progressed
to a marvel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>They were a pair, indeed, to strike the most
stolid imagination, let alone the sensitive,
brooding, watchful imagination of the backwoods.
Tug Blackstock was a tall, spare
figure of a man, narrow of hip, deep of chest,
with something of a stoop to his mighty
shoulders, and his head thrust forward as if
in ceaseless scrutiny of the unseen. His hair,
worn somewhat short and pushed straight
back, was faintly grizzled. His face, tanned
and lean, was markedly wide at the eyes, with
a big, well-modelled nose, a long, obstinate
jaw, and a wide mouth whimsically uptwisted
at one corner.</p>
<p>Except on the trail&mdash;and even then he
usually carried a razor in his pack&mdash;he was
always clean-shaven, just because he didn&rsquo;t
like the curl of his beard. His jacket, shirt,
and trousers were of browny-grey homespun,
of much the same hue as his soft slouch hat,
all as inconspicuous as possible. But at his
throat, loosely knotted under his wide-rolling
shirt collar, he wore usually an ample silk
handkerchief of vivid green spattered with big
yellow spots, like dandelions in a young June
meadow.</p>
<p>As for Jim, at first glance he might almost
have been taken for a slim, young black bear
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
rather than a dog. The shaggy coat bequeathed
to him by his sheep-dog sire gave
to his legs and to his hindquarters an appearance
of massiveness that was almost clumsy.
But under this dense black fleece his lines were
fine and clean-drawn as a bull-terrier&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The hair about his eyes grew so long and
thick that, if left to itself, it would have
seriously interfered with his vision. This his
master could not think of permitting, so the
riotous hair was trimmed down severely, till
Jim&rsquo;s large, sagacious eyes gazed out unimpeded
from ferocious, brush-like rims of stubby
fur about half an inch in length.</p>
<h3 class="generic">II</h3>
<p>For some ten miles above the long, white,
furrowed face of Brine&rsquo;s Rip, where Blue
Forks Brook flows in, the main stream of the
Ottanoonsis is a succession of mad rapids and
toothed ledges and treacherous, channel-splitting
shoals. These ten miles are a trial
of nerve and water-craft for the best canoeists
on the river. In the spring, when the river
was in freshet and the freed logs were racing,
battering, and jamming, the whole reach was
such a death-trap for the stream-drivers that
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
it had come to be known as Dead Man&rsquo;s Run.</p>
<p>Now, in high summer, when the stream was
shrunken in its channel and the sunshine lay
golden over the roaring, creamy chutes and
the dancing shallows, the place looked less
perilous. But it was full of snares and hidden
teeth. It was no place for the canoeist,
however expert with pole and paddle, unless
he knew how to read the water unerringly for
many yards ahead. It is this reading of the
water, this instantaneous solving of the hieroglyphics
of foam and surge and swirl and
glassy lunge, that makes the skilled runner of
the rapids.</p>
<p>A light birch-bark canoe, with a man in the
stern and a small child in the bow, was approaching
the head of the rapids, which were
hidden from the paddler&rsquo;s view by a high,
densely-wooded bend of the shore. The canoe
leapt forward swiftly on the smooth, quiet current,
under the strong drive of the paddle.</p>
<p>The paddler was a tall, big-limbed man, with
fair hair fringing out under his tweed cap, and
a face burnt red rather than tanned by the
weather. He was dressed roughly but well,
and not as a woodsman, and he had a subtle
air of being foreign to the backwoods. He
knew how to handle his paddle, however, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
prow of his craft keeping true though his
strokes were slow and powerful.</p>
<p>The child who sat facing him on a cushion
in the bow was a little boy of four or five
years, in a short scarlet jacket and blue
knickers. His fat, bare legs were covered
with fly-bites and scratches, his baby face of
the tenderest cream and pink, his round, interested
eyes as blue as periwinkle blossoms.
But the most conspicuous thing about him was
his hair. He was bareheaded&mdash;his little cap
lying in the bottom of the canoe among the
luggage&mdash;and the hair, as white as tow, stood
out like a fleece all over his head, enmeshing
the sunlight in its silken tangle.</p>
<p>When the canoe shot round the bend, the
roar of the rapids smote suddenly upon the
voyagers&rsquo; ears. The child turned his bright
head inquiringly, but from his low place could
see nothing to explain the noise. His father,
however, sitting up on the hinder bar of the
canoe, could see a menacing white line of tossing
crests, aflash in the sunlight, stretching
from shore to shore. Backing water vigorously
to check his headway, he stood up to get
a better view and choose his way through the
surge.</p>
<p>The stranger was master of his paddle, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
he had had no adequate experience in running
rapids. Such light and unobstructed rips as
he had gone through had merely sufficed to
make him regard lightly the menace confronting
him. He had heard of the perils of Dead
Man&rsquo;s Run, but that, of course, meant in time
of freshet, when even the mildest streams are
liable to go mad and run amuck. This was
the season of dead low water, and it was hard
for him to imagine there could be anything
really to fear from this lively but shrunken
stream. He was strong, clear-eyed, steady of
nerve, and he anticipated no great trouble in
getting through.</p>
<p>As the light craft dipped into the turmoil,
jumping as if buffeted from below, and the
wave-tops slapped in on either side of the
bow, the little lad gave a cry of fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit tight, boy. Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; said the
father, peering ahead with intent, narrowed
eyes and surging fiercely on his blade to avoid
a boiling rock just below the first chute. As
he swept past in safety he laughed in triumph,
for the passage had been close and exciting,
and the conquest of a mad rapid is one of the
thrilling things in life, and worth going far
for. His laugh reassured the child, who
laughed also, but cowered low in the canoe and
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
stared over the gunwale with wide eyes of
awe.</p>
<p>But already the canoe was darting down
toward a line of black rocks smothered in
foam. The man paddled desperately to gain
the other shore, where there seemed to be a
clear passage. Slanting sharply across the
great current, surging with short, terrific
strokes upon his sturdy maple blade, his teeth
set and his breath coming in grunts, he was
swept on downward, sideways toward the
rocks, with appalling speed. But he made the
passage, swept the bow around, and raced
through, shaving the rock so narrowly that
his heart paused and the sweat jumped out
suddenly cold on his forehead.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards the current swept
him to mid-stream. Just here the channel was
straight and clear of rocks, and though the
rips were heavy the man had a few minutes&rsquo;
respite, with little to do but hold his course.</p>
<p>With a stab at the heart he realized now
into what peril he had brought his baby.
Eagerly he looked for a chance to land, but on
neither side could he make shore with any
chance of escaping shipwreck. A woodsman,
expert with the canoe-pole, might have managed
it, but the stranger had neither pole nor
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
skill to handle one. He was in the grip of the
wild current and could only race on, trusting
to master each new emergency as it should hurl
itself upon him.</p>
<p>Presently the little one took alarm again at
his father&rsquo;s stern-set mouth and preoccupied
eyes. The man had just time to shout once
more, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, son. Dad&rsquo;ll take care
of you,&rdquo; when the canoe was once more in a
yelling chaos of chutes and ledges. And now
there was no respite. Unable to read the
signs of the water, he was full upon each new
peril before he recognized it, and only his great
muscular strength and instant decision saved
them.</p>
<p>Again and again they barely by a hair&rsquo;s-breadth,
slipped through the jaws of death,
and it seemed to the man that the gnashing
ledges raved and yelled behind him at each
miracle of escape. Then hissing wave-crests
cut themselves off and leapt over the racing
gunwale, till he feared the canoe would be
swamped. Once they scraped so savagely
that he thought the bottom was surely ripped
from the canoe. But still he won onward,
mile after roaring mile, his will fighting doggedly
to keep his eyesight from growing hopelessly
confused with the hellish, sliding dazzle
and riot of waters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>But at last the fiend of the flood, having
played with its prey long enough, laid bare its
claws and struck. The bow of the canoe, in
swerving from one foam-curtained rock,
grounded heavily upon another. In an
instant the little craft was swung broadside
on, and hung there. The waves piled upon
her in a yelling pack. She was smothered
down, and rolled over helplessly.</p>
<p>As they shot out into the torrent the man,
with a terrible cry, sprang toward the bow,
striving to reach his son. He succeeded in
catching the little one, with one hand, by the
back of the scarlet jacket. The next moment
he went under and the jacket came off over the
child&rsquo;s head. A whimsical cross-current
dragged the little boy twenty feet off to one
side, and shot him into a shallow side channel.</p>
<p>When the man came to the surface again
his eyes were shut, his face stark white, his
legs and arms flung about aimlessly as weeds;
but fast in his unconscious grip he held the
little red jacket. The canoe, its side stove in,
and full of water, was hurrying off down the
rapid amid a fleet of paddles, cushions, blankets,
boxes, and bundles. The body of the
man, heavy and inert and sprawling, followed
more slowly. The waves rolled it over and
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
trampled it down, shouldered it up again, and
snatched it away viciously whenever it showed
an inclination to hang itself up on some projecting
ledge. It was long since they had had
such a victim on whom to glut their rancour.</p>
<p>The child, meanwhile, after being rolled
through the laughing shallows of the side
channel and playfully buffeted into a half-drowned
unconsciousness, was stranded on a
sand spit some eight or ten yards from the
right-hand shore. There he lay, half in the
water, half out of it, the silken white floss of
his hair all plastered down to his head, the
rippled current tugging at his scratched and
bitten legs.</p>
<p>The unclouded sun shone down warmly
upon his face, slowly bringing back the rose
to his baby lips, and a small, paper-blue butterfly
hovered over his head for a few seconds,
as if puzzled to make out what kind of being
he was.</p>
<p>The sand spit which had given the helpless
little one refuge was close to the shore, but
separated from it by a deep and turbulent current.
A few minutes after the blue butterfly
had flickered away across the foam, a large
black bear came noiselessly forth from the fir
woods and down to the water&rsquo;s edge. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
gazed searchingly up and down the river to
see if there were any other human creatures
in sight, then stretched his savage black muzzle
out over the water toward the sand spit, eyeing
and sniffing at the little unconscious figure
there in the sun. He could not make out
whether it was dead or only asleep. In either
case he wanted it. He stepped into the foaming
edge of the sluice, and stood there whimpering
with disappointed appetite, daunted by
the snaky vehemence of the current.</p>
<p>Presently, as the warmth of the flooding
sun crept into his veins, the child stirred, and
opened his blue eyes. He sat up, noticed he
was sitting in the water, crawled to a dry spot,
and snuggled down into the hot sand. For
the moment he was too dazed to realize where
he was. Then, as the life pulsed back into
his veins, he remembered how his father&rsquo;s hand
had caught him by the jacket just as he went
plunging into the awful waves. Now, the
jacket was gone. His father was gone, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy! Daddee-ee!&rdquo; he wailed. And
at the sound of that wailing cry, so unmistakably
the cry of a youngling for its parent,
the bear drew back discreetly behind a bush,
and glanced uneasily up and down the stream
to see if the parent would come in answer to
the appeal. He had a wholesome respect for
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
the grown-up man creature of either sex, and
was ready to retire on the approach of one.</p>
<p>But no one came. The child began to sob
softly, in a lonesome, frightened, suppressed
way. In a minute or two, however, he stopped
this, and rose to his feet, and began repeating
over and over the shrill wail of &ldquo;Daddy, Dad-dee-ee,
Daddee-ee!&rdquo; At the same time he
peered about him in every direction, almost
hopefully, as if he thought his father must be
hiding somewhere near, to jump out presently
for a game of bo-peep with him.</p>
<p>His baby eyes were keen. They did not find
his father, but they found the bear, its great
black head staring at him from behind a bush.</p>
<p>His cries stopped on the instant, in the
middle of a syllable, frozen in his throat with
terror. He cowered down again upon the
sand, and stared, speechless, at the awful
apparition. The bear, realizing that the little
one&rsquo;s cries had brought no succour, came out
from its hiding confidently, and down to the
shore, and straight out into the water till the
current began to drag too savagely at its legs.
Here it stopped, grumbling and baffled.</p>
<p>The little one, unable any longer to endure
the dreadful sight, backed to the extreme edge
of the sand, covered his face with his hands,
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
and fell to whimpering piteously, an unceasing,
hopeless, monotonous little cry, as vague and
inarticulate as the wind.</p>
<p>The bear, convinced at length that the sluice
just here was too strong for him to cross, drew
back to the shore reluctantly. It moved slowly
up-stream some forty or fifty yards, looking
for a feasible crossing. Disappointed in this
direction, it then explored the water&rsquo;s edge for
a little distance down-stream, but with a like
result. But it would not give up. Up and
down, up and down, it continued to patrol the
shore with hungry obstinacy. And the piteous
whimpering of the little figure that cowered,
with hidden face upon the sand spit, gradually
died away. That white fleece of silken locks,
dried in the sun and blown by the warm breeze,
stood out once more in its radiance on the
lonely little slumbering head.</p>
<h3 class="generic">III</h3>
<p>Tug Blackstock sat on a log, smoking and
musing, on the shore of that wide, eddying
pool, full of slow swirls and spent foam clusters,
in which the tumbling riot of Brine&rsquo;s Rip
came to a rest. From the mills behind him
screeched the untiring saws. Outstretched at
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
his feet lay Jim, indolently snapping at flies.
The men of the village were busy in the mills,
the women in their cottages, the children in
their schools; and the stretch of rough shore
gave Tug Blackstock the solitude which he
loved.</p>
<p>Down through the last race of the rapids
came a canoe paddle, and began revolving
slowly in the eddies. Blackstock pointed it
out to Jim, and sent him in after it. The dog
swam for it gaily, grabbed it by the top so
that it could trail at his side, and brought it
to his master&rsquo;s feet. It was a good paddle, of
clean bird&rsquo;s-eye maple and Melicite pattern,
and Tug Blackstock wondered who could have
been so careless as to lose it. Carelessness is
a vice regarded with small leniency in the
backwoods.</p>
<p>A few minutes later down the rapids came
wallowing a water-logged birch-canoe. The
other things which had started out with it, the
cushions and blankets and bundles, had got
themselves tangled in the rocks and left behind.</p>
<p>At sight of the wrecked canoe, Tug Blackstock
rose to his feet. He began to suspect
another of the tragedies of Dead Man&rsquo;s Run.
But what river-man would come to grief in
the Run at this stage of the water? Blackstock
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
turned to an old dug-out which lay hauled
up on the shore, ran it down into the water and
paddled out to salvage the wrecked canoe. He
towed it to shore, emptied it, and scrutinized
it. He thought he knew every canoe on the
river, but this one was a stranger to him. It
had evidently been brought across the Portage
from the east coast. Then he found, burnt
into the inside of the gunwale near the bow,
the letters J. C. M. W.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Englishman,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
let the canoe git away from him at the head
of the Run, likely, when he&rsquo;s gone ashore.
He&rsquo;d never have tried to shoot the Run alone,
an&rsquo; him with no experience of rapids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he was uneasy. He decided that he
would get his own canoe and pole up through
the rapids, just to satisfy himself.</p>
<p>Tug Blackstock&rsquo;s canoe, a strong and swift
&ldquo;Fredericton&rdquo; of polished canvas, built on
the lines of a racing birch, was kept under
cover in his wood shed at the end of the village
street. He shouldered it, carrying it over his
head with the mid bar across his shoulders,
and bore it down to the water&rsquo;s edge. Then
he went back and fetched his two canoe poles
and his paddles.</p>
<p>Waving Jim into the bow, he was just about
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
to push off when his narrowed eyes caught
sight of something else rolling and threshing
helplessly down the rapid. Only too well he
saw what it was. His face pale with concern,
he thrust the canoe violently up into the tail
of the rapid, just in time to catch the blindly
sprawling shape before it could sink to the
depths of the pool. Tenderly he lifted it out
upon the shore. It was battered almost out
of recognition, but he knew it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor devil! Poor devil!&rdquo; he muttered
sorrowfully. &ldquo;He was a man all right, but
he didn&rsquo;t understand rapids for shucks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he noticed that in the dead man&rsquo;s right
hand was clutched a tiny child&rsquo;s jacket. He
understood&mdash;he saw the whole scene, and he
swore compassionately under his breath, as he
unloosed the rigid fingers. Alive or dead, the
little one must be found at once.</p>
<p>He called Jim sharply, and showed him the
soaked red jacket. Jim sniffed at it, but the
wearer&rsquo;s scent was long ago soaked out of it.
He looked it over, and pawed it, wagging his
tail doubtfully. He could see it was a small
child&rsquo;s jacket, but what was he expected to
do with it?</p>
<p>After a few moments, Tug Blackstock
patted the jacket vigorously, and then waved
his arm up-stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go, find him, Jim!&rdquo; he ordered. Jim,
hanging upon each word and gesture, comprehended
instantly. He was to find the owner
of the little jacket&mdash;a child&mdash;somewhere up
the river. With a series of eager yelps&mdash;which
meant that he would do all that living
dog could do&mdash;he started up the shore, on
the full run.</p>
<p>By this time the mill whistles had blown,
the screaming of the saws had stopped, the
men, powdered with yellow sawdust, were
streaming out from the wide doors. They
flocked down to the water.</p>
<p>In hurried words Blackstock explained the
situation. Then he stepped once more into
his canoe, snatched his long, steel-shod pole,
and thrust his prow up into the wild current,
leaving the dead man to the care of the coroner
and the village authorities. Before he had
battled his way more than a few hundred
yards upwards through the raging smother,
two more canoes, with expert polers standing
poised in them like statues, had pushed out to
follow him in his search.</p>
<p>The rest of the crowd picked up the body
and bore it away reverently to the court-room,
with sympathetic women weeping beside it.</p>
<p>Racing along the open edge of the river
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
where it was possible, tearing fiercely through
thicket and underbrush where rapids or rocks
made the river&rsquo;s edge impassable, the great
black dog panted onwards with the sweat dripping
from jaws and tongue. Whenever he
was forced away from the river, he would
return to it at every fifty yards or so, and
scan each rock, shoal or sand spit with keen,
sagacious eyes. He had been told to search
the river&mdash;that was the plain interpretation
of the wet jacket and of Tug Blackstock&rsquo;s
gesture&mdash;so he wasted no time upon the woods
and the undergrowth.</p>
<p>At last he caught sight of the little fluffy-headed
figure huddled upon the sand spit far
across the river. He stopped, stared intently,
and then burst into loud, ecstatic barkings as
an announcement that his search had been successful.
But the noise did not carry across
the tumult of the ledge, and the little one slept
on, exhausted by his terror and his grief.</p>
<p>It was not only the sleeping child that Jim
saw. He saw the bear, and his barking broke
into shrill yelps of alarm and appeal. He
could not see that the sluice between the sand
spit and the bank was an effective barrier, and
he was frantic with anxiety lest the bear should
attack the little one before he could come to
the rescue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>His experienced eye told him in a moment
that the river was impassable for him at this
point. He dashed on up-stream for another
couple of hundred yards, and then, where a
breadth of comparatively slack water beneath
a long ledge extended more than half-way
across, he plunged in, undaunted by the clamour
and the jumping, boiling foam.</p>
<p>Swimming mightily, he gained a point
directly above the sand spit. Then, fighting
every inch of the way to get across the terrific
draft of the main current, he was swept downward
at a tremendous speed. But he had carried
out his plan. He gained the shallow side
channel, splashed down it, and darted up the
sand spit with a menacing growl at the bear
across the sluice.</p>
<p>At the sound of that harsh growl close to
his ears the little one woke up and raised his
head. Seeing Jim, big and black and dripping,
he thought it was the bear. With a
piercing scream he once more hid his face in
his hands, rigid with horror. Puzzled at this
reception, Jim fell to licking his hands and his
ears extravagantly, and whining and thrusting
a coaxing wet nose under his arms.</p>
<p>At last the little fellow began to realize that
these were not the actions of a foe. Timidly
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
he lowered his hands from his face, and looked
around. Why, there was the bear, on the
other side of the water, tremendous and terrible,
but just where he had been this ever so
long. This creature that was making such a
fuss over him was plainly a dog&mdash;a kind, good
dog, who was fond of little boys.</p>
<p>With a sigh of inexpressible relief his terror
slipped from him. He flung his arms about
Jim&rsquo;s shaggy neck and buried his face in the
wet fur. And Jim, his heart swelling with
pride, stood up and barked furiously across at
the bear.</p>
<p>Tug Blackstock, standing in the stern of his
canoe, plied his pole with renewed effort.
Reaching the spit he strode forward, snatched
the child up in his arms, and passed his great
hand tenderly through that wonderful shock
of whitey-gold silken curls. His eyes were
moist, but his voice was hearty and gay, as if
this meeting were the most ordinary thing in
the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Woolly Billy!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What
are you doin&rsquo; here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy left me here,&rdquo; answered the child,
his lip beginning to quiver. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s he
gone to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Tug Blackstock hurriedly,
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
&ldquo;yer dad was called away rather sudden, an&rsquo;
he sent me an&rsquo; Jim, here, to look after you till
he gits back. An&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll do it, too, Woolly
Billy; don&rsquo;t you fret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s George Harold Manners
Watson,&rdquo; explained the child politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll just call you Woolly Billy for
short,&rdquo; said Tug Blackstock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<h2 id="c2">II. THE BOOK AGENT AND THE BUCKSKIN BELT</h2>
<h3 class="generic">I</h3>
<p>A big-framed, jaunty man with black
side-whiskers, a long black frock coat,
and a square, flat case of shiny black leather
strapped upon his back, stepped into the Corner
Store at Brine&rsquo;s Rip Mills.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;Hullo, boys! Hot day!&rdquo; in a big
voice that was intentionally hearty, ran his
bulging eyes appraisingly over every one present,
then took off his wide-brimmed felt hat
and mopped his glistening forehead with a big
red and white handkerchief. Receiving a
more or less hospitable chorus of grunts and
&ldquo;hullos&rdquo; in response, he seated himself on a
keg of nails, removed the leather case from
his back, and asked for ginger beer, which he
drank noisily from the bottle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name of Byles,&rdquo; said he at length, introducing
himself with a sweeping nod. &ldquo;Hot
tramp in from Cribb&rsquo;s Ridge. Thirsty, you
bet. Never drink nothing stronger&rsquo;n ginger
pop or soft cider. Have a round o&rsquo; pop on me,
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
boys. A1 pop this o&rsquo; yours, mister. A dozen
more bottles, please, for these gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked around the circle with an air at
once assured and persuasive. And the taciturn
woodsmen, not wholly at ease under such
sudden cordiality from a stranger, but too
polite to rebuff him, muttered &ldquo;Thank ye,
kindly,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s how,&rdquo; as they threw back
their heads and poured the weak stuff down
their gaunt and hairy throats.</p>
<p>It was a slack time at Brine&rsquo;s Rip, the mills
having shut down that morning because the
river was so low that there were no more logs
running. The shrieking saws being silent for
a little, there was nothing for the mill hands
to do but loaf and smoke. The hot air was
heavily scented with the smell of fresh sawdust
mixed with the strong honey-perfume of the
flowering buckwheat fields beyond the village.
The buzzing of flies in the windows of the store
was like a fine arabesque of sound against the
ceaseless, muffled thunder of the rapids.</p>
<p>The dozen men gathered here at Zeb Smith&rsquo;s
store&mdash;which was, in effect, the village club&mdash;found
it hard to rouse themselves to a conversational
effort in any way worthy the advances
of the confident stranger. They all
smoked a little harder than usual, and looked
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
on with courteous but noncommittal interest
while he proceeded to unstrap his shiny black
leather case.</p>
<p>In his stiff and sombre garb, so unsuited to
the backwoods trails, the stranger had much
the look of one of those itinerant preachers
who sometimes busy themselves with the cure
of souls in the remoter backwoods settlements.
But his eye and his address were rather those
of a shrewd and pushing commercial traveller.</p>
<p>Tug Blackstock, the Deputy Sheriff of Nipsiwaska
County, felt a vague antagonism
toward him, chiefly on the ground that his
speech and bearing did not seem to consort
with his habiliments. He rather liked a man
to look what he was or be what he looked, and
he did not like black side whiskers and long
hair. This antagonism, however, he felt to
be unreasonable. The man had evidently had
a long and tiring tramp, and was entitled to a
somewhat friendlier reception than he was
getting.</p>
<p>Swinging his long legs against the counter,
on which he sat between a pile of printed
calicoes and a box of bright pink fancy soap,
Tug Blackstock reached behind him and possessed
himself of a box of long, black cigars.
Having selected one critically for himself, he
proffered the box to the stranger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have a weed?&rdquo; said he cordially. &ldquo;They
ain&rsquo;t half bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the stranger waved the box aside with
an air at once grand and gracious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never touch the weed, thank you kindly
just the same,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve nothing
agin it. It goes agin my system, that&rsquo;s all.
If it&rsquo;s all the same to you, I&rsquo;ll take a bite o&rsquo;
cheese an&rsquo; a cracker &rsquo;stead o&rsquo; the cigar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sartain,&rdquo; agreed Blackstock, jumping
down to fetch the edibles from behind the
counter. Like most of the regular customers,
he knew the store and its contents almost as
well as Zeb Smith himself.</p>
<p>During the last few minutes an immense,
rough-haired black dog had been sniffing the
stranger over with suspicious minuteness.
The stranger at first paid no attention whatever,
though it was an ordeal that many might
have shrunk from. At last, seeming to notice
the animal for the first time, he recognized his
presence by indifferently laying his hand upon
his neck. Instead of instantly drawing off
with a resentful growl, after his manner with
strangers, the dog acknowledged the casual
caress by a slight wag of the tail, and then,
after a few moments, turned away amicably
and lay down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;If Jim finds him all right,&rdquo; thought Blackstock
to himself, &ldquo;ther&rsquo; can&rsquo;t be <i>much</i> wrong
with him, though I can&rsquo;t say I take to him
myself.&rdquo; And he weighed off a much bigger
piece of cheese than he had at first intended to
offer, marking down his indebtedness on a
slate which served the proprietor as a sort of
day-book. The stranger fell to devouring it
with an eagerness which showed that his lunch
must have been of the lightest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye was sayin&rsquo; as how ye&rsquo;d jest come up
from Cribb&rsquo;s Ridge?&rdquo; put in a long-legged,
heavy-shouldered man who was sprawling on
a cracker box behind the door. He had short
sandy hair, rapidly thinning, eyes of a cold
grey, set rather close together, and a face that
suggested a cross between a fox and a fish-hawk.
He was somewhat conspicuous among
his fellows by the trimness of his dress, his
shirt being of dark blue flannel with a rolled-up
collar and a scarlet knotted kerchief, while the
rest of the mill hands wore collarless shirts of
grey homespun, with no thought of neckerchiefs.</p>
<p>His trousers were of brown corduroy, and
were held up by a broad belt of white dressed
buckskin, elaborately decorated with Navajo
designs in black and red. He stuck to this
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
adornment tenaciously as a sort of inoffensive
proclamation of the fact that he was not an
ordinary backwoods mill hand, but a wanderer,
one who had travelled far, and tried his wits
at many ventures in the wilder West.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; assented the stranger,
brushing some white cracker crumbs out of
his black whiskers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was jest a-wonderin&rsquo;,&rdquo; went on Hawker,
giving a hitch to the elaborate belt and leaning
forward a little to spit out through the doorway,
&ldquo;if ye&rsquo;ve seed anything o&rsquo; Jake Sanderson
on the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger, having his mouth full of
cheese, did not answer for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys are lookin&rsquo; for him rather
anxious,&rdquo; explained Blackstock with a grin.
&ldquo;He brings the leetle fat roll that pays their
wages here at the mill, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s due sometime
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seen him at Cribb&rsquo;s Ridge this morning,&rdquo;
answered the stranger at last. &ldquo;Said
he&rsquo;d hurt his foot, or strained his knee, or
something, an&rsquo; would have to come on a bit
slow. He&rsquo;ll be along sometime to-night, I
guess. Didn&rsquo;t seem to me to have much wrong
with him. No, ye can&rsquo;t have none o&rsquo; that
cheese. Go &rsquo;way an&rsquo; lay down,&rdquo; he added suddenly
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
to the great black dog, who had returned
to his side and laid his head on the stranger&rsquo;s
knee.</p>
<p>With a disappointed air the dog obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t often Jim&rsquo;s so civil to a stranger,&rdquo;
muttered Blackstock to himself.</p>
<p>A little boy in a scarlet jacket, with round
eyes of china blue, and an immense mop of
curly, fluffy, silky hair so palely flaxen as to
be almost white, came hopping and skipping
into the store. He was greeted with friendly
grins, while several voices drawled, &ldquo;Hullo,
Woolly Billy!&rdquo; He beamed cheerfully upon
the whole company, with a special gleam of
intimate confidence for Tug Blackstock and
the big black dog. Then he stepped up to the
stranger&rsquo;s knee, and stood staring with respectful
admiration at those flowing jet-black side-whiskers.</p>
<p>The stranger in return looked with a cold
curiosity at the child&rsquo;s singular hair. Neither
children nor dogs had any particular appeal
for him, but that hair was certainly queer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most an albino, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Tug Blackstock,
curtly. The dog, detecting a note of resentment
in his master&rsquo;s voice, got up and stood
beside the child, and gazed about the circle with
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
an air of anxious interrogation. Had any one
been disagreeable to Woolly Billy? And if
so, who?</p>
<p>But the little one was not in the least rebuffed
by the stranger&rsquo;s unresponsiveness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he inquired, patting admiringly
the stranger&rsquo;s shiny leather case.</p>
<p>The stranger grew cordial to him at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, now ye&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said he enthusiastically,
undoing the flap of the case. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
book, sonny. The greatest book, the most
<i>interestin&rsquo;</i> book, the most useful book&mdash;and
next to the Bible the most high-toned, uplifting
book that was ever written. Ye can&rsquo;t
read yet, sonny, but this book has the loveliest
pictures ye ever seen, and the greatest lot of
&rsquo;em for the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew reverently forth from the case a
large, fat volume, bound sumptuously in embossed
sky-blue imitation leather, lavishly gilt,
and opened it upon his knees with a spacious
gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he continued proudly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
called &lsquo;Mother, Home, and Heaven!&rsquo; Ain&rsquo;t
that a title for ye? Don&rsquo;t it show ye right
off the kind of book it is? With this book
by ye, ye don&rsquo;t need any other book in the
house at all, except maybe the almanack an&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
the Bible&mdash;an&rsquo; this book has lots o&rsquo; the best
bits out of the Bible in it, scattered through
among the receipts an&rsquo; things to keep it all
wholesome an&rsquo; upliftin&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll tell ye such useful things as how to
get a cork out of a bottle without breakin&rsquo; the
bottle, when ye haven&rsquo;t got a corkscrew, or
what to do when the baby&rsquo;s got croup, and
there ain&rsquo;t a doctor this side of Tourdulac.
An&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll tell ye how to live, so as when things
happen that no medicines an&rsquo; no doctors and
no receipts&mdash;not even such great receipts as
these here ones&rdquo; (and he slapped his hand on
the counter) &ldquo;can help ye through&mdash;such as
when a tree falls on to ye, or you trip and
stumble on to the saws, or git drawn down
under half-a-mile o&rsquo; raft&mdash;then ye&rsquo;ll be ready
to go right up aloft, an&rsquo; no questions asked ye
at the Great White Gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; it has po&rsquo;try in it, too, reel <i>heart</i>
po&rsquo;try, such as&rsquo;ll take ye back to the time when
ye was all white an&rsquo; innocent o&rsquo; sin at yer
mother&rsquo;s knee, an&rsquo; make ye wish ye was like
that now. In fact, boys, this book I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;
to show ye, with your kind permission, is
handier than a pocket in a shirt, an&rsquo; at the
same time the blessed fragrance of it is like a
rose o&rsquo; Sharon in the household. It&rsquo;s in three
styles o&rsquo; bindin&rsquo;, all <i>reel</i> handsome, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want to look at another picture now,&rdquo;
protested Woolly Billy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of this one
of the angels sayin&rsquo; their prayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His amazing shock of silver-gold curls was
bent intently over the book in the stranger&rsquo;s
lap. The woodsmen, on the other hand, kept
on smoking with a far-off look, as if they heard
not a word of the fluent harangue. They had
a deep distrust and dread of this black-whiskered
stranger, now that he stood revealed
as the Man-Wanting-to-Sell-Something. The
majority of them would not even glance in the
direction of the gaudy book, lest by doing so
they should find themselves involved in some
expensive and complicated obligation.</p>
<p>The stranger responded to Woolly Billy&rsquo;s
appeal by shutting the book firmly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
lots more pictures purtier than that one,
sonny,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But ye must ask yer dad
to buy it fer ye. He won&rsquo;t regret it.&rdquo; And
he passed the volume on to Hawker, who, having
no dread of book-agents, began to turn over
the leaves with a superior smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s gone away ever so far,&rdquo; answered
Woolly Billy sadly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an awfully pretty
book.&rdquo; And he looked at Tug Blackstock
appealingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, mister,&rdquo; drawled Blackstock.
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t take much stock myself in those kind
of books, an&rsquo; moreover (not meanin&rsquo; no offence
to you), any man that&rsquo;s sellin&rsquo; &rsquo;em has got to
larn to do a sight o&rsquo; lyin&rsquo;. But as Woolly
Billy here wants it so bad I&rsquo;ll take a copy, if
&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t too dear. All the same, it&rsquo;s only fair
to warn ye that ye&rsquo;ll not do much business in
Brine&rsquo;s Rip, for there was a book agent here
last year as got about ha&rsquo;f the folks in the
village to sign a crooked contract, and we was
all stung bad. I&rsquo;d advise ye to move on, an&rsquo;
not really tackle Brine&rsquo;s Rip fer another year
or so. Now, what&rsquo;s the price?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger&rsquo;s face had fallen during this
speech, but it brightened at the concluding
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six dollars, four dollars, an&rsquo; two dollars
an&rsquo; a half, accordin&rsquo; to style of bindin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he
answered, bringing out a handful of leaflets
and order forms and passing them round
briskly. &ldquo;An&rsquo; ye don&rsquo;t need to pay more&rsquo;n
fifty cents down, an&rsquo; sign this order, an&rsquo; ye
pay the balance in a month&rsquo;s time, when the
books are delivered. I&rsquo;ll give ye my receipt
for the fifty cents, an&rsquo; ye jest fill in this order
accordin&rsquo; to the bindin&rsquo; ye choose. Let me
advise ye, as a friend, to take the six dollar
one. It&rsquo;s the best value.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks jest the same,&rdquo; said Blackstock
drily, pulling out his wallet, &ldquo;but I guess
Woolly Billy&rsquo;d jest as soon have the two-fifty
one. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll pay ye the cash right now. No
signin&rsquo; orders fer me. Here&rsquo;s my name an&rsquo;
address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right ye are,&rdquo; agreed the stranger cordially,
pocketing the money and signing the
receipt. &ldquo;Cash payments for me every time,
if I could have <i>my</i> way. Now, if some o&rsquo; you
other gentlemen will follow Mr. Blackstock&rsquo;s
fine example, ye&rsquo;ll never regret it&mdash;an&rsquo; neither
will I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Woolly Billy. Come on, Jim,&rdquo;
said Blackstock, stepping out into the street
with the child and the dog at his heels.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be gittin&rsquo; along home, an&rsquo; leave this
gentleman to argy with the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 class="generic">II</h3>
<p>Jake Sanderson, with the pay for the mill-hands,
did not arrive that night, nor yet the
following morning. Along toward noon, however,
there arrived a breathless stripling, white-faced
and wild-eyed, with news of him. The
boy was young Stephens, son of Andy Stephens,
the game-warden. He and his father,
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
coming up from Cribb&rsquo;s Ridge, had found the
body of Sanderson lying half in a pool beside
the road, covered with blood. Near at hand
lay the bag, empty, slashed open with a bloody
knife. Stephens had sent his boy on into the
Settlement for help, while he himself had remained
by the body, guarding it lest some
possible clue should be interfered with.</p>
<p>Swift as a grass fire, the shocking news
spread through the village. An excited crowd
gathered in front of the store, every one talking
at once, trying to question young Stephens.
The Sheriff was away, down at Fredericton
for a holiday from his arduous duties. But
nobody lamented his absence. It was his
deputy they all turned to in such an emergency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Tug Blackstock?&rdquo; demanded half
a dozen awed voices. And, as if in answer,
the tall, lean figure of the Deputy Sheriff of
Nipsiwaska County came striding in haste up
the sawdusty road, with the big, black dog
crowding eagerly upon his heels.</p>
<p>The clamour of the crowd was hushed as
Blackstock put a few questions, terse and pertinent,
to the excited boy. The people of
Nipsiwaska County in general had the profoundest
confidence in their Deputy Sheriff.
They believed that his shrewd brain and keen
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
eye could find a clue to the most baffling of
mysteries. Just now, however, his face was
like a mask of marble, and his eyes, sunk back
into his head, were like points of steel. The
murdered man had been one of his best friends,
a comrade and helper in many a hard enterprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he to the lad, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll go an&rsquo;
see.&rdquo; And he started off down the road at
that long loose stride of his, which was swifter
than a trot and much less tiring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on a minute, Tug,&rdquo; drawled a rasping
nasal voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Hawker?&rdquo; demanded Blackstock,
turning impatiently on his heel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye hain&rsquo;t asked nothin&rsquo; yet about the Book
Agent, Mister Byles, him as sold ye &lsquo;Mother,
Home, an&rsquo; Heaven.&rsquo; Maybe <i>he</i> could give us
some information. He <i>said</i> as how he&rsquo;d had
some talk with poor old Jake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackstock&rsquo;s lips curled slightly. He had
not read the voluble stranger as a likely highwayman
in any circumstances, still less as one
to try issues with a man like Jake Sanderson.
But the crowd, eager to give tongue on any
kind of a scent, and instinctively hostile to a
book agent, seized greedily upon the suggestion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; &ldquo;Send for him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Did
anybody see him this mornin&rsquo;?&rdquo; &ldquo;Rout him
out!&rdquo; &ldquo;Fetch him along!&rdquo; The babel of
voices started afresh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s cleared out,&rdquo; cried a woman&rsquo;s shrill
voice. It was the voice of Mrs. Stukeley, who
kept the boarding-house. Every one else was
silent to hear what she had to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He quit my place jest about daylight this
morning,&rdquo; continued the woman virulently.
She had not liked the stranger&rsquo;s black whiskers,
nor his ministerial garb, nor his efforts to get
a subscription out of her, and she was therefore
ready to believe him guilty without further
proof. &ldquo;He seemed in a powerful hurry
to git away, sayin&rsquo; as how the Archangel
Gabriel himself couldn&rsquo;t do business in this
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing the effect her words produced, and
that even the usually imperturbable and disdainful
Deputy Sheriff was impressed by them,
she could not refrain from embroidering her
statement a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now ez I come to think of it,&rdquo; she went
on, &ldquo;I did notice as how he seemed kind of
excited an&rsquo; nervous like, so&rsquo;s he could hardly
stop to finish his breakfus&rsquo;. But he took time
to make me knock half-a-dollar off his bill.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mac,&rdquo; said Blackstock sharply, turning to
Red Angus MacDonald, the village constable,
&ldquo;you take two of the boys an&rsquo; go after the
Book Agent. Find him, an&rsquo; fetch him back.
But no funny business with him, mind you.
We hain&rsquo;t got a spark of evidence agin him.
We jest want him as a witness, mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd&rsquo;s excitement was somewhat
damped by this pronouncement, and Hawker&rsquo;s
exasperating voice was heard to drawl:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No <i>evidence</i>, hey? Ef that ain&rsquo;t <i>evidence</i>,
him skinnin&rsquo; out that way afore sun-up, I&rsquo;d
like to know what is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But to this and similar comments Tug Blackstock
paid no heed whatever. He hurried on
down the road toward the scene of the tragedy,
his lean jaws working grimly upon a huge
chew of tobacco, the big, black dog not now at
his heels but trotting a little way ahead and
casting from one side of the road to the other,
nose to earth. The crowd came on behind,
but Blackstock waved them back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want none o&rsquo; ye to come within
fifty paces of me, afore I tell ye to,&rdquo; he announced
with decision. &ldquo;Keep well back, all
of ye, or ye&rsquo;ll mess up the tracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this proved a decree too hard to be
enforced for any length of time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>When he arrived at the place where the
game-warden kept watch beside the murdered
man, Blackstock stood for a few moments in
silence, looking down upon the body of his
friend with stony face and brooding eyes. In
spite of his grief, his practised observation
took in the whole scene to the minutest detail,
and photographed it upon his memory for
reference.</p>
<p>The body lay with face and shoulder and one
leg and arm in a deep, stagnant pool by the
roadside. The head was covered with black,
clotted blood from a knife-wound in the neck.
Close by, in the middle of the road, lay a stout
leather satchel, gaping open, and quite empty.
Two small memorandum books, one shut and
the other with white leaves fluttering, lay near
the bag. Though the roadway at this point
was dry and hard, it bore some signs of a
struggle, and toward the edge of the water
there were several little, dark, caked lumps of
puddled dust.</p>
<p>Blackstock first examined the road minutely,
all about the body, but the examination, even
to such a practised eye as his, yielded little
result. The ground was too hard and dusty
to receive any legible trail, and, moreover, it
had been carelessly over-trodden by the game-warden
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
and his son. But whether he found
anything of interest or not, Blackstock&rsquo;s grim,
impassive face gave no sign.</p>
<p>At length he went over to the body, and
lifted it gently. The coat and shirt were
soaked with blood, and showed marks of a
fierce struggle. Blackstock opened the shirt,
and found the fatal wound, a knife-thrust
which had been driven upwards between the
ribs. He laid the body down again, and at
the same time picked up a piece of paper,
crumpled and blood-stained, which had lain
beneath it. He spread it open, and for a
moment his brows contracted as if in surprise
and doubt. It was one of the order forms for
&ldquo;Mother, Home, and Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He folded it up and put it carefully between
the leaves of the note-book which he always
carried in his pocket.</p>
<p>Stephens, who was close beside him, had
caught a glimpse of the paper, and recognized
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he exclaimed, under his breath.
&ldquo;I never thought o&rsquo; <i>him</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Blackstock only shook his head slowly,
and called the big black dog, which had been
waiting all this time in an attitude of keen
expectancy, with mouth open and tail gently
wagging.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take a good look at him, Jim,&rdquo; said Blackstock.</p>
<p>The dog sniffed the body all over, and then
looked up at his master as if for further
directions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; now take a sniff at this.&rdquo; And he
pointed to the rifled bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of it?&rdquo; he inquired
when the dog had smelt it all over minutely.</p>
<p>Jim stood motionless, with ears and tail
drooping, the picture of irresolution and
bewilderment.</p>
<p>Blackstock took out again the paper which
he had just put away, and offered it to the
dog, who nosed it carefully, then looked at
the dead body beside the pool, and growled
softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seek him, Jim,&rdquo; said Blackstock.</p>
<p>At once the dog ran up again to the body,
and back to the open book. Then he fell to
circling about the bag, nose to earth, seeking
to pick up the elusive trail.</p>
<p>At this point the crowd from the village,
unable longer to restrain their eagerness,
surged forward, led by Hawker, and closed in,
effectually obliterating all trails. Jim growled
angrily, showing his long white teeth, and
drew back beside the body as if to guard it.
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
Blackstock stood watching his action with a
brooding scrutiny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that bit o&rsquo; paper ye found under
him, Tug?&rdquo; demanded Hawker vehemently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None o&rsquo; yer business, Sam,&rdquo; replied the
deputy, putting the blood-stained paper back
into his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seen what it was,&rdquo; shouted Hawker to
the rest of the crowd. &ldquo;It was one o&rsquo; them
there dokyments that the book agent had, up
to the store. I always <i>said</i> as how &rsquo;twas
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll ketch him!&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll string him
up!&rdquo; yelled the crowd, starting back along the
road at a run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sech fools!&rdquo; shouted Blackstock.
&ldquo;Hold on! Come back I tell ye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he might as well have shouted to a flock
of wild geese on their clamorous voyage
through the sky. Fired by Sam Hawker&rsquo;s
exhortations, they were ready to lynch the
black-whiskered stranger on sight.</p>
<p>Blackstock cursed them in a cold fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll <i>hev</i> to go after them, Andy,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;or there&rsquo;ll be trouble when they find that there
book agent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better give &rsquo;em their head, Tug,&rdquo; protested
the warden. &ldquo;Guess he done it all
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
right. He&rsquo;ll git no more&rsquo;n&rsquo;s good for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Maybe</i> he did it, an&rsquo; then agin, maybe he
didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted the Deputy, &ldquo;an&rsquo; anyways,
they&rsquo;re just plumb looney now. You stay
here, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll follow them up. Send Bob back
to the Ridge to fetch the coroner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and started on the run in pursuit
of the shouting crowd, whistling at the same
time for the dog to follow him. But to his
surprise Jim did not obey instantly. He was
very busy digging under a big whitish stone
at the other side of the pool. Blackstock
halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; he commanded angrily, &ldquo;git out o&rsquo;
that! What d&rsquo;ye mean by foolin&rsquo; about after
woodchucks a time like this? Come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim lifted his head, his muzzle and paws
loaded with fresh earth, and gazed at his master
for a moment. Then, with evident reluctance,
he obeyed. But he kept looking back
over his shoulder at the big white stone, as if
he hated to leave it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot o&rsquo; ordinary pup left in that
there dawg yet,&rdquo; explained Blackstock apologetically
to the game-warden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t a dawg ever lived that
wouldn&rsquo;t want to dig out a woodchuck,&rdquo; answered
Stephens.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<h3 class="generic">III</h3>
<p>The black-whiskered stranger had been overtaken
by his pursuers about ten miles beyond
Brine&rsquo;s Rip, sleeping away the heat of the day
under a spreading birch tree a few paces off
the road. He was sleeping soundly&mdash;too
soundly indeed, as thought the experienced
constable, for a man with murder on his soul.</p>
<p>But when he was roughly aroused and seized,
he seemed so terrified that his captors were all
the more convinced of his guilt. He made no
resistance as he was being hurried along the
road, only clinging firmly to his black leather
case, and glancing with wild eyes from side to
side as if nerving himself to a desperate dash
for liberty.</p>
<p>When he had gathered, however, a notion of
what he was wanted for, to the astonishment
of his captors, his terror seemed to subside&mdash;a
fact which the constable noted narrowly.
He steadied his voice enough to ask several
questions about the murder&mdash;questions to
which reply was curtly refused. Then he
walked on in a stolid silence, the ruddy colour
gradually returning to his face.</p>
<p>A couple of miles before reaching Brine&rsquo;s
Rip, the second search party came in sight,
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
the Deputy Sheriff at the head of it and the
shaggy black form of Jim close at his heels.
With a savage curse Hawker sprang forward,
and about half the party with him, as if to
snatch the prisoner from his captors and take
instant vengeance upon him.</p>
<p>But Blackstock was too quick for them. The
swiftest sprinter in the county, he got to the
other party ahead of the mob and whipped
around to face them, with one hand on the big
revolver at his hip and Jim showing his teeth
beside him. The constable and his party,
hugely astonished, but confident that Blackstock&rsquo;s
side was the right one to be on, closed
protectingly around the prisoner, whose eyes
now almost bulged from his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep right back, boys,&rdquo; commanded
the Deputy in a voice of steel. &ldquo;The law will
look after this here prisoner, if he&rsquo;s the guilty
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fur as we kin see, there ain&rsquo;t no &lsquo;if&rsquo; about
it,&rdquo; shouted Hawker, almost frothing at the
mouth. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man as done it, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;re
agoin&rsquo; to string &rsquo;im up fer it right now, for fear
he might git off some way atween the jedges
an&rsquo; the lawyers. You keep out of it now,
Tug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About half the crowd surged forward with
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
Hawker in front. Up came Blackstock&rsquo;s gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye know me, boys,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Keep
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They kept back. They all <i>fell</i> back, indeed,
some paces, except Hawker, who held his
ground, half crouching, his lips distorted in a
snarl of rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw now, quit it, Sam,&rdquo; urged one of his
followers. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t worth it. An&rsquo; Tug&rsquo;s
right, anyways. The law&rsquo;s good enough, with
Tug to the back of it.&rdquo; And putting forth a
long arm he dragged Hawker back into the
crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put away yer gun, Tug,&rdquo; expostulated
another. &ldquo;Seein&rsquo;s ye feel that way about it,
we won&rsquo;t interfere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackstock stuck the revolver back into his
belt with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad ye&rsquo;ve come back to yer senses, boys,&rdquo;
said he, perceiving that the crisis was over.
&ldquo;But keep an eye on Hawker for a bit yet.
Seems to &rsquo;ave gone clean off his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fret, Tug. We&rsquo;ll look after him,&rdquo;
agreed several of his comrades from the mill,
laying firmly persuasive hands upon the excited
man, who cursed them for cowards till they
began to chaff him roughly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s makin&rsquo; you so sore, Sam?&rdquo; demanded
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
one. &ldquo;Did the book agent try to make
up to Sis Hopkins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s Tug that Sis is making eyes at
now,&rdquo; suggested another. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s
puttin&rsquo; Sam so off his nut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave the lady&rsquo;s name out of it, boys,&rdquo;
interrupted Blackstock, in a tone that carried
conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit that jaw now, Sam,&rdquo; interposed another,
changing the subject, &ldquo;an&rsquo; tell us what
ye&rsquo;ve done with that fancy belt o&rsquo; yourn &rsquo;at
ye&rsquo;re so proud of. We hain&rsquo;t never seen ye
without it afore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; chimed in the constable.
&ldquo;That accounts for his foolishness. Sam
<i>ain&rsquo;t</i> himself without that fancy belt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hawker stopped his cursing and pulled himself
together with an effort, as if only now
realizing that his followers had gone over
completely to the side of the law and Tug
Blackstock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Busted the buckle,&rdquo; he explained quickly.
&ldquo;Mend it when I git time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; said Blackstock presently,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll git right back along to where poor
Jake&rsquo;s still layin&rsquo;, and there we&rsquo;ll ask this here
stranger what <i>he</i> knows about it. It&rsquo;s there,
if anywheres, where we&rsquo;re most likely to git
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
some light on the subject. I&rsquo;ve sent over to
the Ridge fer the coroner, an&rsquo; poor Jake can&rsquo;t
be moved till he comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The book agent, his confidence apparently
restored by the attitude of Blackstock, now
let loose a torrent of eloquence to explain how
glad he would be to tell all he knew, and how
sorry he was that he knew nothing, having
merely had a brief conversation with poor Mr.
Sanderson on the morning of the previous day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll hev lots o&rsquo; time to tell us all that
when we&rsquo;re askin&rsquo; ye,&rdquo; answered Blackstock.
&ldquo;Now, take my advice an&rsquo; keep yer mouth
shet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Blackstock was speaking, Jim slipped in
alongside the prisoner and rubbed against him
with a friendly wag of the tail as if to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to see you in such a hole, old chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the men laughed, and one who was
more or less a friend of Hawker&rsquo;s, remarked
sarcastically:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim don&rsquo;t seem quite so discriminatin&rsquo; as
usual, Tug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the Deputy
drily, noting the dog&rsquo;s attitude with evident
interest. &ldquo;Time will show. Ye must remember
a man ain&rsquo;t <i>necessarily</i> a murderer jest
because he wears black side-lights an&rsquo; tries to
sell ye a book that ain&rsquo;t no good.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;No good!&rdquo; burst out the prisoner, reddening
with indignation. &ldquo;You show me another
book that&rsquo;s half as good, at double the price,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll give you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shet up, you!&rdquo; ordered the Deputy, with
a curious look. &ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t no picnic ye&rsquo;re
on, remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then some one, as if for the first time,
thought of the money for which Sanderson
had been murdered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t ye search him, Tug?&rdquo; he
demanded. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hev a look in that there
black knapsack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye bloomin&rsquo; fool,&rdquo; shouted Hawker, again
growing excited, &ldquo;ye don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose he&rsquo;d be carryin&rsquo;
it on him, do ye? He&rsquo;d hev it buried
somewheres in the woods, where he could git
it later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right ye are, Sam,&rdquo; agreed the Deputy.
&ldquo;The man as done the deed ain&rsquo;t likely to
carry the evidence around on him. But all the
same we&rsquo;ll search the prisoner bime-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time the strange procession had got
back to the scene of the tragedy it had been
swelled by half the population of the village.
At Blackstock&rsquo;s request, Zeb Smith, the proprietor
of the store, who was also a magistrate,
swore in a score of special constables to keep
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
back the crowd while awaiting the arrival of
the coroner. Under the magistrate&rsquo;s orders&mdash;which
satisfied Blackstock&rsquo;s demand for
strict formality of procedure&mdash;the prisoner
was searched, and could not refrain from
showing a childish triumph when nothing was
found upon him.</p>
<p>Passing from abject terror to a ridiculous
over-confidence, he with difficulty restrained
himself from seizing the opportunity to
harangue the crowd on the merits of &ldquo;Mother,
Home, and Heaven.&rdquo; His face was wreathed
in fatuous smiles as he saw the precious book
snatched from its case and passed around
mockingly from hand to hand. He certainly
did not look like a murderer, and several of
the crowd, including Stephens, the game-warden,
began to wonder if they had not been
barking up the wrong tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the idee,&rdquo; remarked Stephens,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;d take a baker&rsquo;s dozen o&rsquo; that chap to do in
Jake Sanderson that way. The skate as killed
Jake was some man, anyways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know,&rdquo; sneered Hawker, &ldquo;how
ye&rsquo;re going to account for that piece o&rsquo; paper,
the book-agent&rsquo;s paper, &rsquo;at Tug Blackstock
found there under the body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, shucks!&rdquo; answered the game-warden,
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s easy. He&rsquo;s been a-sowin&rsquo; &rsquo;em round
the country so&rsquo;s anybody could git hold of &rsquo;em,
same&rsquo;s you er me, Sam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This harmless, if ill-timed pleasantry appeared
to Hawker, in his excitement, a wanton
insult. His lean face went black as thunder,
and his lips worked with some savage retort
that would not out. But at that instant came
a strange diversion. The dog Jim, who under
Blackstock&rsquo;s direction had been sniffing long
and minutely at the clothes of the murdered
man, at the rifled leather bag, and at the ground
all about, came suddenly up to Hawker and
stood staring at him with a deep, menacing
growl, while the thick hair rose stiffly along
his back.</p>
<p>For a moment there was dead silence save
for that strange accusing growl. Hawker&rsquo;s
face went white to the lips. Then, in a blaze
of fury he yelled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Git out o&rsquo; that! I&rsquo;ll teach ye to come
showin&rsquo; yer teeth at me!&rdquo; And he launched
a savage kick at the animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;JIM!! Come here!&rdquo; rapped out the command
of Tug Blackstock, sharp as a rifle shot.
And Jim, who had eluded the kick, trotted back,
still growling, to his master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever ye been doin&rsquo; to Jim, Sam?&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
demanded one of the mill hands. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t
never seen him act like that afore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s <i>always</i> had a grudge agin me,&rdquo;
panted Hawker, &ldquo;coz I had to give him a
lickin&rsquo; once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now ye&rsquo;re lyin&rsquo;, Sam Hawker,&rdquo; said
Blackstock quietly. &ldquo;Ye know right well as
how you an&rsquo; Jim were good friends only yesterday
at the store, where I saw ye feedin&rsquo;
him. An&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t think likely ye&rsquo;ve ever given
Jim a lickin&rsquo;. It don&rsquo;t <i>sound</i> probable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me there&rsquo;s a lot of us has gone
a bit off their nut over this thing, an&rsquo; not much
wonder, neither,&rdquo; commented the game-warden.
&ldquo;Looks like Sam Hawker has gone
plumb crazy. An&rsquo; now there&rsquo;s Jim, the sensiblest
dog in the world, with lots more brains
than most men-kind, foolin&rsquo; away his time like
a year-old pup a-tryin&rsquo; to dig out a darn old
woodchuck hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such, in fact, seemed to be Jim&rsquo;s object. He
was digging furiously with both forepaws beneath
the big white stone on the opposite side
of the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s bit me. I&rsquo;ll kill him,&rdquo; screamed
Hawker, his face distorted and foam at the
corners of his lips. He plucked his hunting-knife
from its sheath, and leapt forward
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
wildly, with the evident intention of darting
around the pool and knifing the dog.</p>
<p>But Blackstock, who had been watching him
intently, was too quick for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ye don&rsquo;t, Sam!&rdquo; he snapped, catching
him by the wrist with such a wrench that the
bright blade fell to the ground. With a
scream, Hawker struck at his face, but Blackstock
parried the blow, tripped him neatly, and
fell on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold him fast, boys,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;Seems
like he&rsquo;s gone mad. Don&rsquo;t let him hurt himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In five seconds the raving man was trussed
up helpless as a chicken, his hands tied behind
his back, his legs lashed together at the knees,
so that he could neither run nor kick. Then
he was lifted to his feet, and held thus, inexorably
but with commiseration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to be rough with ye, Sam,&rdquo; said one
of the constables, &ldquo;but ye&rsquo;ve gone crazy as a
bed-bug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never knowed Sam was such a friend o&rsquo;
Jake&rsquo;s!&rdquo; muttered another, with deepest pity.</p>
<p>But Blackstock stood close beside the body
of the murdered man, and watched with a face
of granite the efforts of Jim to dig under the
big white stone. His absorption in such an
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
apparently frivolous matter attracted the
notice of the crowd. A hush fell upon them
all, broken only by the hoarse, half-smothered
ravings of Sam Hawker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no woodchuck Jim&rsquo;s diggin&rsquo; for,
you see!&rdquo; muttered one of the constables to
the puzzled Stephens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tug don&rsquo;t seem to think so, neither,&rdquo;
agreed Stephens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angus,&rdquo; said Blackstock in a low, strained
voice to the constable who had just spoken,
&ldquo;would ye mind stepping round an&rsquo; givin&rsquo; Jim
a lift with that there stone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The constable hastened to obey. As he
approached, Jim looked up, his face covered
thickly with earth, wagged his tail in greeting,
then fell to work again with redoubled energy.</p>
<p>The constable set both hands under the
stone, and with a huge heave turned it over.
With a yelp of delight Jim plunged his head
into the hole, grabbed something in his mouth,
and tore around the pool with it. The something
was long and whitish, and trailed as he
ran. He laid it at Blackstock&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>Blackstock held it up so that all might see
it. It was a painted Indian belt, and it was
stained and smeared with blood. The constable
picked out of the hole a package of bills.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>For some moments no one spoke, and even
the ravings of Hawker were stilled.</p>
<p>Then Tug Blackstock spoke, while every one,
as if with one consent, turned his eyes away
from the face of Sam Hawker, unwilling to
see a comrade&rsquo;s shame and horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a matter now for jedge and jury,
boys,&rdquo; said he in a voice that was grave and
stern. &ldquo;But I think you&rsquo;ll all agree that we
hain&rsquo;t no call to detain this gentleman, who&rsquo;s
been put to so much inconvenience all on
account of our little mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it, don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; protested
the book agent, as his guards, with
profuse apologies, released him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a
mighty intelligent dawg o&rsquo; yours, Mr. Blackstock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sure done <i>you</i> a good turn this day,
mister,&rdquo; replied the Deputy grimly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h2 id="c3">III. THE HOLE IN THE TREE</h2>
<h3 class="generic">I</h3>
<p>It was Woolly Billy who discovered the pile&mdash;notes
and silver, with a few stray gold
pieces&mdash;so snugly hidden under the fish-hawk&rsquo;s
nest.</p>
<p>The fish-hawk&rsquo;s nest was in the crotch of
the old, half-dead rock-maple on the shore of
the desolate little lake which lay basking in the
flat-lands about a mile back, behind Brine&rsquo;s
Rip Mills.</p>
<p>As the fish-hawk is one of the most estimable
of all the wilderness folk, both brave and inoffensive,
troubling no one except the fat and
lazy fish that swarmed in the lake below, and
as he is protected by a superstition of the backwoodsmen,
who say it brings ill-luck to disturb
the domestic arrangements of a fish-hawk, the
big nest, conspicuous for miles about, was
never disturbed by even the most amiable
curiosity.</p>
<p>But Woolly Billy, not fully acclimatized to
the backwoods tradition and superstition, and
uninformed as to the firmness and decision
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
with which the fish-hawks are apt to resent any
intrusion, had long hankered to explore the
mysteries of that great nest. One morning
he made up his mind to try it.</p>
<p>Tug Blackstock, Deputy Sheriff of Nipsiwaska
County, was away for a day or two, and
old Mrs. Amos, his housekeeper, was too deaf
and rheumatic to &ldquo;fuss herself&rdquo; greatly about
the &ldquo;goings-on&rdquo; of so fantastic a child as
Woolly Billy, so long as she knew he had Jim
to look after him. This serves to explain how
a small boy like Woolly Billy, his seven-years-and-nine-months
resting lightly on his amazingly
fluffy shock of pale flaxen curls, could
be trotting off down the lonely backwoods trail
with no companion or guardian but a big, black
dog.</p>
<p>Woolly Billy was familiar with the mossy
old trail to the lake, and did not linger upon it.
Reaching the shore, he wasted no time throwing
sticks in for Jim to retrieve, but, in spite
of the dog&rsquo;s eager invitations to this pastime,
made his way along the dry edge between
undergrowth and water till he came to the
bluff. Pushing laboriously through the hot,
aromatic-scented tangle of bushes, he climbed
to the foot of the old maple, which looked
dwarfed by the burden of the huge nest carried
in its crotch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>Woolly Billy was an expert tree-climber, but
this great trunk presented new problems.
Twice he went round it, finding no likely spot
to begin. Then, certain roughnesses tempted
him, and he succeeded in drawing himself up
several feet. Serene in the consciousness of
his good intentions, he struggled on. He
gained perhaps another foot. Then he stuck.
He pulled hard upon a ragged edge of bark,
trying to work his way further around the
trunk. A patch of bark came away suddenly
in his grip and he fell backwards with a startled
cry.</p>
<p>He fell plump on Jim, rolled off into the
bushes, picked himself up, shook the hair out
of his eyes and stood staring up at a round
hole in the trunk where the patch of bark had
been.</p>
<p>A hole in a tree is always interesting. It
suggests such possibilities. Forgetting his
scratches, Woolly Billy made haste to climb
up again, in spite of Jim&rsquo;s protests. He peered
eagerly into the hole. But he could see
nothing. And he was cautious&mdash;for one
could never tell what lived in a hole like that&mdash;or
what the occupant, if there happened to be
any, might have to say to an intruder. He
would not venture his hand into the unknown.
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
He slipped down, got a bit of stick and thrust
<i>that</i> into the hole. There was no result, but
he learnt that the hole was shallow. He stirred
the stick about. There came a slight jingling
sound in return.</p>
<p>Woolly Billy withdrew the stick and thought
for a moment. He reasoned that a thing that
jingled was not at all likely to bite. He dropped
the stick and cautiously inserted his hand to
the full length of his little arm. His fingers
grasped something which felt more or less
familiar, and he drew forth a bank-note and
several silver coins.</p>
<p>Woolly Billy&rsquo;s eyes grew very round and
large as he stared at his handful. He was
sure that money did not grow in hollow trees.
Tug Blackstock kept <i>his</i> money in an old black
wallet. Woolly Billy liked money because it
bought peppermints, and molasses candy, and
gingerpop. But this money was plainly not
his. He reluctantly put it back into the hole.</p>
<p>Thoughtfully he climbed down. He knew
that money was such a desirable thing that it
led some people&mdash;bad people whom Tug
Blackstock hated&mdash;to steal what did not belong
to them. He picked up the patch of bark
and laboriously fitted it back into its place over
the hole, lest some of these bad people should
find the money and appropriate it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word, now, not one single word,&rdquo; he
admonished Jim, &ldquo;till Tug comes home.
We&rsquo;ll tell him all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 class="generic">II</h3>
<p>It was five o&rsquo;clock in the sleepy summer
afternoon, and the flies buzzed drowsily
among the miscellaneous articles that graced
the windows of the Corner Store. The mills
had shut down early, because the supply of
logs was running low in the boom, and no
more could be expected until there should be
a rise of water. Some half-dozen of the mill
hands were sitting about the store on nail-kegs
and soap-boxes, while Zeb Smith, the proprietor,
swung his long legs lazily from the edge
of the littered counter.</p>
<p>Woolly Billy came in with a piece of silver
in his little fist to buy a packet of tea for Mrs.
Amos. Jim, not liking the smoke, stayed outside
on the plank sidewalk, and snapped at
flies. The child, who was regarded as the
mascot of Brine&rsquo;s Rip Mills, was greeted with
a fire of solemn chaff, which he received with
an impartial urbanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, quit coddin&rsquo; the kiddie, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t try
to be so smart,&rdquo; growled Long Jackson, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
Magadavy river-man, lifting his gaunt length
from a pile of axe-handles, and thrusting his
fist deep into his trousers&rsquo; pocket. &ldquo;Here,
Zeb, give me a box of peppermints for Woolly
Billy. He hain&rsquo;t been in to see us this long
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled out a handful of coins and dollar
bills, and proceeded to select a silver bit from
the collection. The sight was too much for
Woolly Billy, bursting with his secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> know where there&rsquo;s <i>lots</i> more money like
that,&rdquo; he blurted out proudly, &ldquo;in a hole in a
tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the past twelve months or more
there had been thefts of money, usually of
petty sums, in Brine&rsquo;s Rip Mills and the neighbourhood,
and all Tug Blackstock&rsquo;s detective
skill had failed to gain the faintest clue to the
perpetrator. Suspicions there had been, but
all had vanished into thin air at the touch of
investigation. Woolly Billy&rsquo;s amazing statement,
therefore, was like a little bombshell in
the shop.</p>
<p>Every one of his audience stiffened up with
intense interest.</p>
<p>One swarthy, keen-featured, slim-waisted,
half-Indian-looking fellow, with the shapely
hands and feet that mark so many of the Indian
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
mixed-bloods, was sitting on a bale of
homespun behind Long Jackson, and smoking
solemnly with half-closed lids. His eyes
opened wide for a fraction of a second, and
darted one searching glance at the child&rsquo;s face.
Then he dropped his lids slowly once more till
the eyes were all but closed. The others all
stared eagerly at Woolly Billy.</p>
<p>Pleased with the interest he had excited,
Woolly Billy glanced about him, and shook
back his mop of pale curls self-consciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Lots</i> more!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Big handfuls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he remembered his discretion, his resolve
to tell no one but Tug Blackstock about
his discovery. Seeking to change the subject,
he beamed upon Long Jackson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Long,&rdquo; he said politely. &ldquo;I
<i>love</i> peppermints. An&rsquo; Jim loves them, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Where</i> did you say that hole in the tree
was?&rdquo; asked Long Jackson, reaching for the
box that held the peppermints, and ostentatiously
filling a generous paper-bag.</p>
<p>Woolly Billy looked apologetic and deprecating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Long, if you don&rsquo;t mind <i>very</i> much,
I can&rsquo;t tell anybody but Tug Blackstock <i>that</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson laid the bag of peppermints a little
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
to one side, as if to convey that their transfer
was contingent upon Woolly Billy&rsquo;s behaviour.</p>
<p>The child looked wistfully at the coveted
sweets; then his red lips compressed themselves
with decision and resentment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell anybody but Tug Blackstock,
<i>of course</i>,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t want any
peppermints, thank you, Long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He picked up his package of tea and turned
to leave the shop, angry at himself for having
spoken of the secret and angry at Jackson for
trying to get ahead of Tug Blackstock. Jackson,
looking annoyed at the rebuff, extended
his leg and closed the door. Woolly Billy&rsquo;s
blue eyes blazed. One of the other men strove
to propitiate him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on, Woolly Billy,&rdquo; he urged
coaxingly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t git riled at Long. You an&rsquo;
him&rsquo;s pals, ye know. We&rsquo;re all pals o&rsquo; yourn,
an&rsquo; of Tug&rsquo;s. An&rsquo; there ain&rsquo;t no harm <i>at all</i>,
at all, in yer showin&rsquo; us this &rsquo;ere traysure what
you&rsquo;ve lit on to. Besides, you know there&rsquo;s
likely some o&rsquo; that there traysure belongs to
us &rsquo;uns here. Come on now, an&rsquo; take us to
yer hole in the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; to git out o&rsquo; this here store,
Woolly Billy, I tell ye that, till ye promise to
take us to it right off,&rdquo; said Long Jackson
sharply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Woolly Billy was not alarmed in the least
by this threat. But he was so furious that for
a moment he could not speak. He could do
nothing but stand glaring up at Long Jackson
with such fiery defiance that the good-natured
mill-hand almost relented. But it chanced
that he was one of the sufferers, and he was in
a hurry to get his money back. At this point
the swarthy woodsman on the bale of homespun
opened his narrow eyes once again, took
the pipe from his mouth, and spoke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit plaguin&rsquo; the kid, Long,&rdquo; he drawled.
&ldquo;The cash&rsquo;ll be all there when Tug Blackstock
gits back, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll save a lot of trouble an&rsquo;
misunderstandin&rsquo;, havin&rsquo; him to see to dividin&rsquo;
it up fair an&rsquo; square. Let Woolly Billy out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long Jackson shook his head obstinately,
and opened his mouth to reply, but at this
moment Woolly Billy found his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me out! Let me out! <i>Let me out!</i>&rdquo;
he screamed shrilly, stamping his feet and
clenching his little fists.</p>
<p>Instantly a heavy body was hurled upon the
outside of the door, striving to break it in.</p>
<p>Zeb Smith swung his long legs down from
the counter hurriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kid&rsquo;s right, an&rsquo; Black Dan&rsquo;s right.
Open the door, Long, an&rsquo; do it quick. I don&rsquo;t
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
want that there dawg comin&rsquo; through the winder.
An&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll be doin&rsquo; it, too, in half a jiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Git along, then, Woolly, if ye insist on it.
But no more peppermints, mind,&rdquo; growled
Jackson, throwing open the door and stepping
back discreetly. As he did so, Jim came in
with a rush, just saving himself from knocking
Woolly Billy over. One swift glance assured
him that the child was all right, but very
angry about something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Jim. Come with me,&rdquo; said
Woolly Billy, tugging at the animal&rsquo;s collar.
And the pair stalked away haughtily side by
side.</p>
<h3 class="generic">III</h3>
<p>Tug Blackstock arrived the next morning
about eleven. Before he had time to sit down
for a cup of that strenuous black tea which the
woodsmen consume at all hours, he had heard
from Woolly Billy&rsquo;s eager lips the story of the
hole in the tree beneath the fish-hawk&rsquo;s nest.
He heard also of the episode at Zeb Smith&rsquo;s
store, but Woolly Billy by this time had quite
forgiven Long Jackson, so the incident was
told in such a way that Blackstock had no
reason to take offence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Long tried <i>hard</i>,&rdquo; said the child, &ldquo;to get
me to tell where that hole was, but I <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i>.
And Black Dan was awful nice, an&rsquo; made him
stop botherin&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; said I was quite right
not to tell <i>anybody</i> till you came home, coz
you&rsquo;d know just what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said the Deputy-Sheriff thoughtfully,
&ldquo;Long&rsquo;s had a lot of money stole from
him, so, of course, he wanted to git his eyes
on to that hole quick. But &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t like Black
Dan to be that thoughtful. Maybe he <i>hasn&rsquo;t</i>
had none taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was speaking, a bunch of the mill-hands
arrived at the door, word of Blackstock&rsquo;s
return having gone through the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to go an&rsquo; help ye find that traysure,
Tug,&rdquo; said Long Jackson, glancing somewhat
sheepishly at Woolly Billy. A friendly
grin from the child reassured him, and he went
on with more confidence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We tried to git the kiddie to tell us where
&rsquo;twas, but wild steers wouldn&rsquo;t drag it out o&rsquo;
him till you got back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Long,&rdquo; agreed Blackstock,
&ldquo;but it don&rsquo;t need to be no expedition. We
don&rsquo;t want the whole village traipsin&rsquo; after us.
You an&rsquo; three or four more o&rsquo; the boys that&rsquo;s
lost money come along, with Woolly Billy an&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
me, an&rsquo; the rest o&rsquo; you meet us at the store in
about a couple o&rsquo; hours&rsquo; time. Tell any other
folks you see that I don&rsquo;t want &rsquo;em follerin&rsquo;
after us, because it may mix up things&mdash;an&rsquo;
anyways, I don&rsquo;t want it, see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few moments&rsquo; hesitation and consultation
the majority of the mill-hands turned
away, leaving Long Jackson and big Andy
Stevens, the blue-eyed giant from the Oromocto
(who had been one of the chief victims),
and MacDonald, and Black Saunders, and
Black Dan (whose name had been Dan Black
till the whim of the woodsmen turned it about).
Blackstock eyed them appraisingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know as <i>you&rsquo;d</i> bin one o&rsquo; the victims
too, Dan,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t ye, Tug?&rdquo; returned Black with a
short laugh. &ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t say nawthin
about it, coz I was after doin&rsquo; a leetle detective
work on me own, an&rsquo; mebbe I&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave got in
ahead o&rsquo; ye if Woolly Billy here hadn&rsquo;t a&rsquo; been
so smart. But I tell ye, Tug, if that there
traysure&rsquo;s the lot we&rsquo;re thinkin&rsquo; it is, there&rsquo;d
ought ter be a five-dollar bill in it what I&rsquo;ve
marked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; grunted the Deputy, hastily gulping
down the last of his tea, and rising to his
feet. &ldquo;But Woolly Billy an&rsquo; me <i>and</i> Jim&rsquo;s a
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
combination pretty hard to git ahead of, I&rsquo;m
thinkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the party neared the bluff whereon the
tree of the fish-hawk&rsquo;s nest stood ragged
against the sky, the air grew rank with the
pungent odour of skunk. Now skunks were
too common in the region of Brine&rsquo;s Rip Mills
for that smell, as a rule, to excite any more
comment than an occasional disgusted execration
when it became too concentrated. But
to-day it drew more than passing attention.
MacDonald sniffed intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s deuced queer,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve
noticed that there&rsquo;s always been a smell of
skunk round when anybody&rsquo;s lost anything.
Did it ever strike you that way, Tug?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, some!&rdquo; assented the Deputy curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a skunk, all right, that&rsquo;s been takin&rsquo;
our money,&rdquo; said big Andy, &ldquo;ef he <i>don&rsquo;t</i> carry
his tail over his back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every one of the party was sniffing the
tainted air as if the familiar stench were some
rare perfume&mdash;all but Jim. He had had an
encounter with a skunk, once in his impulsive
puppy days, and the memory was too painful
to be dwelt upon.</p>
<p>As they climbed the slope, one of the fish-hawks
came swooping down from somewhere
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
high in the blue, and began circling on slow
wings about the nest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That cross old bird doesn&rsquo;t like visitors,&rdquo;
remarked Woolly Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t, neether, Woolly Billy, if
you was a fish-hawk,&rdquo; said Jackson.</p>
<p>Arrived at the tree, Woolly Billy pointed
eagerly to a slightly broken piece of bark a
little above the height of the Deputy&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>There&rsquo;s</i> the hole!&rdquo; he cried, clapping his
hands in his excitement as if relieved to find it
had not vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep off a bit now, boys,&rdquo; cautioned Blackstock.
Drawing his long hunting-knife, he
carefully loosened the bark without letting his
hand come in contact with it, and on the point
of the blade laid it aside against the foot of
the trunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t any of you tech it,&rdquo; he admonished.</p>
<p>Then he slipped his hand into the hole, and
felt about.</p>
<p>A look of chagrin came over his face, and
he withdrew his hand&mdash;empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; there!&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was there yesterday morning,&rdquo; protested
Woolly Billy, his blue eyes filling with
tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, of course,&rdquo; agreed Blackstock,
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
glancing slowly around the circle of disappointed
faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody from the store&rsquo;s been blabbin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
exclaimed Black Dan, in a loud and angry
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; why not?&rdquo; protested Big Andy, with
a guilty air. &ldquo;We never said nawthin&rsquo; about
keepin&rsquo; it a secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of their disappointment, the mill-hands
laughed. Big Andy was not one to
keep a secret in any case, and his weakness for
a certain pretty widow who kept the post-office
was common comment. Big Andy responded
by blushing to the roots of his blonde hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim!&rdquo; commanded the Deputy. And the
big black dog bounded up to him, his eyes
bright with expectation. The Deputy picked
him up, and held him aloft with his muzzle to
the edges of the hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smell that,&rdquo; he ordered, and Jim sniffed
intently. Then he set him down and directed
him to the piece of bark. That, too, Jim&rsquo;s
nose investigated minutely, his feathered tail
slowly wagging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seek him,&rdquo; ordered Blackstock.</p>
<p>Jim whined, looked puzzled, and sniffed
again at the bark. The information which
his subtle nose picked up there was extremely
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
confusing. First, there was the smell of
skunk&mdash;but that smell of skunk was everywhere,
dulling the keenness of his discrimination.
Then, there was a faint, faint reminiscence
of Woolly Billy. But there was Woolly
Billy, at Tug Blackstock&rsquo;s side. Certainly,
there could be no reason for him to seek Woolly
Billy. Then there was an elusive, tangled
scent, which for some moments defied him. At
last, however, he got a clue to it. With a
pleased bark&mdash;his way of saying &ldquo;Eureka!&rdquo;&mdash;he
whipped about, trotted over to big Andy
Sevens, sat down in front of him, and gazed
up at him, with tongue hanging and an air of
friendly inquiry, as much as to say: &ldquo;Here I
am, Andy. But I don&rsquo;t know what Tug
Blackstock wants me to seek you for, seein&rsquo; as
you&rsquo;re right here alongside him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big Andy dropped his hand on the dog&rsquo;s
head familiarly; then noticing the sudden tense
silence of the party, his eyes grew very big
and round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you all starin&rsquo; at <i>me</i> fer, boys?&rdquo;
he demanded, with a sort of uneasy wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ax Jim,&rdquo; responded Black Dan, harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon old Jim&rsquo;s makin&rsquo; a mistake fer
once, Tug,&rdquo; drawled Long Jackson, who was
Andy&rsquo;s special pal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>The Deputy rubbed his lean chin reflectively.
There could be no one more above suspicion in
his eyes than this transparently honest young
giant from the Oromocto. But Jim&rsquo;s curious
action had scattered to the winds, at least for
a moment, a sort of hypothesis which he had
been building up in his mind. At the same
time, he felt dimly that a new clue was being
held out to him, if he could only grasp it. He
wanted time to think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We kin all make mistakes,&rdquo; he announced
sententiously. &ldquo;Come here, Jim. Seek &rsquo;im,
boy, seek &rsquo;im.&rdquo; And he waved his hand at
large.</p>
<p>Jim bounced off with a joyous yelp, and began
quartering the ground, hither and thither,
all about the tree. Big Andy, at a complete
loss for words, stood staring from one to
another with eyes of indignant and incredulous
reproach.</p>
<p>Suddenly a yelp of triumph was heard in
the bushes, a little way down towards the lake,
and Jim came racing back with a dark magenta
article in his mouth. At the foot of the tree
he stopped, and looked at Blackstock interrogatively.
Receiving no sign whatever from his
master, whose face had lit up for an instant,
but was now as impassive as a hitching-post,
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
he stared at Black Dan for a few seconds, and
then let his eyes wander back to Andy&rsquo;s face.
In the midst of his obvious hesitation the Oromocto
man stepped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Durned ef that ain&rsquo;t one o&rsquo; my old mittens,&rdquo;
he exclaimed eagerly, &ldquo;what Sis knit
fer me. I&rsquo;ve been lookin&rsquo; fer &rsquo;em everywheres.
Bring it here, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the dog trotted up with it obediently, the
Deputy intervened and stopped him. &ldquo;You
shall have it bime-by, Andy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;ef it&rsquo;s
yourn. But jest now I don&rsquo;t want nobody to
tech it except Jim. Ef you acknowledge it&rsquo;s
yourn&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Of course</i> it&rsquo;s mine,&rdquo; interrupted Andy
resentfully. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I want to find the other
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Blackstock. &ldquo;Drop it, Jim.
Go find the other mitt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jim went ranging once more through the
bushes, the whole party moved around to the
other side of the tree to get out of the downpour
of the noon sun. As they passed the
magenta mitten Black Dan picked it up and
examined it ostentatiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do ye know it&rsquo;s <i>yourn</i>, Andy?&rdquo; he
demanded. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of magenta mitts
in the world, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Tug Blackstock turned upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said I didn&rsquo;t want no one to tech that
mitt,&rdquo; he snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, beg pardon, Tug,&rdquo; said Dan, dropping
the mitt. &ldquo;I forgot. &rsquo;S&rsquo;pose it might kind o&rsquo;
confuse Jim&rsquo;s scent, gittin&rsquo; another smell besides
Andy&rsquo;s on to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might,&rdquo; replied the Deputy coolly, &ldquo;an&rsquo;
then agin, it mightn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a little while every one was quiet, listening
to Jim as he crashed about through the
bushes, and confidently but unreasonably expecting
him to reappear with the other mitten.
Or, at least, that was what Big Andy and
Woolly Billy expected. The Deputy, at least,
did not. At last he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with Mac here, boys,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;that there may be somethin&rsquo; more&rsquo;n skunk in
this skunk smell. We&rsquo;ll jest look into it a bit.
You all keep back a ways&mdash;an&rsquo; you, Long, jest
keep an eye on Woolly Billy ef ye don&rsquo;t mind,
while I go on with Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He whistled to the dog, and directed his
attention to a spot at the foot of the tree
exactly beneath the hole. Jim sniffed hard
at the spot, then looked up at his master with
tail drooping despondently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know it&rsquo;s skunk, plain skunk,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
agreed the Deputy. &ldquo;But I want him. Seek
him, Jim&mdash;<i>seek him</i>, boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus reassured, Jim&rsquo;s tail went up again.
He started off through the bushes, down towards
the lake, with his master close behind
him. The rest of the party followed thirty
paces or so behind.</p>
<p>The trail led straight down to the lake&rsquo;s edge.
Here Jim stopped short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>That</i> skunk&rsquo;s a kind o&rsquo; water-baby,&rdquo; remarked
Long Jackson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you think so?&rdquo; queried Woolly
Billy, much interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered Jackson. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you see he&rsquo;s took to the water? Now, yer common,
no-account skunk hates wettin&rsquo; his fur
like pizen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Deputy examined the hard, white sand
at the water&rsquo;s edge. It showed faint traces of
moccasined feet. He pursed his lips. It was
an old game, but a good one, this breaking a
trail by going into the water. He had no way
of deciding whether his quarry had turned up
the lake shore or down towards the outlet. He
guessed at the latter as the more likely alternative.</p>
<p>Jim trotted slowly ahead, sniffing every foot
of ground along the water&rsquo;s edge. As they
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
approached the outlet the shore became muddy,
and Jackson swung Woolly Billy up on to his
shoulder. Once in the outlet, the foreshore
narrowed to a tiny strip of bare rock between
the water and an almost perpendicular bank
covered with shrubs and vines. All at once
the smell of skunk, which had been almost left
behind, returned upon the air with fresh pungency.
Blackstock stopped short and scanned
the bank with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>A second or two later, Jim yelped his signal,
and his tail went up. He sniffed eagerly across
the ribbon of rock, and then leapt at the face
of the bank.</p>
<p>The Deputy called him off and hurried to
the spot. The rest of the party, much excited,
closed up to within four or five paces, when a
wave of the Deputy&rsquo;s hand checked them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; ejaculated Black Dan, holding his
nose. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a skunk hole in that there
bank. Ye&rsquo;ll be gittin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; in the eye,
Tug, ef ye don&rsquo;t keep off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackstock, who was busy pulling apart the
curtain of vines, paid no attention, but Long
Jackson answered sarcastically:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye call yerself a woodsman, Dan,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;an&rsquo; ye don&rsquo;t know that the hole where a
skunk lives <i>don&rsquo;t</i> smell any. Yer <i>reel</i> skunk&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
quite a gentleman and keeps his home always
clean an&rsquo; tidy. Tug Blackstock ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo;
to git nawthin&rsquo; in the eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon we&rsquo;d better smoke,&rdquo; said
Black Dan amiably, pulling out his pipe and
filling it. And the others followed his example.</p>
<p>Blackstock thrust his hand into a shallow
hole in the bank quite hidden by the foliage.
He drew out a pair of moccasins, water-soaked,
and hurriedly set them down on the rock. For
all their soaking, they reeked of skunk. He
picked up one on the point of a stick and examined
it minutely. In spite of all the soaking,
the sole, to his initiated eye, still bore traces
of that viscous, oily liquid which no water will
wash off&mdash;the strangling exudation of the
skunk&rsquo;s defensive gland. It was just what he
had expected. The moccasin was neat and
slim and of medium size&mdash;not more than
seven at most. He held it up, that all might
see it clearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does this belong to you, Andy Stevens?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>There was a jeer from the group, and Big
Andy held up an enormous foot, which might,
by courtesy, have been numbered a thirteen.
It was a point upon which the Oromocto man
was usually sensitive, but to-day he was proud
of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll hev to play Cinderella, Tug, an&rsquo; find
out what leetle foot it fits on to,&rdquo; suggested
MacDonald.</p>
<p>The Deputy fished again in the hole. He
drew forth a magenta mitten, dropped it
promptly, then held it up on the point of his
stick at arm&rsquo;s length. It had been with the
moccasins. Big Andy stepped forward to
claim it, then checked himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mite too strong fer me now,&rdquo; he
protested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hev to git Sis to knit me
another pair, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackstock dropped the offensive thing beside
the moccasins at his feet, and reached
once more into the hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t takin&rsquo; no risks this time, boys,&rdquo;
said Blackstock. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s took the swag with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a growl of disappointment.
Long Jackson could not refrain from a reproachful
glance at Woolly Billy, but refrained
from saying the obvious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are ye goin&rsquo; to do about it, Tug?&rdquo;
demanded Black Dan. &ldquo;Hev ye got any kind
of a <i>reel</i> clue, d&rsquo;ye think, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait an&rsquo; see,&rdquo; was Blackstock&rsquo;s noncommittal
reply. He picked up the moccasins and
mitten again on the point of his stick, scanned
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
the bank sharply to make sure his quarry had
not gone that way, and led the procession once
more down along the rocky shore of the stream.
&ldquo;Seek him,&rdquo; he said again to Jim, and the dog,
as before, trotted on ahead, sniffing along by
the water&rsquo;s edge to intercept the trail of whoever
had stepped ashore.</p>
<p>The party emerged at length upon the bank
of the main stream, and turned upwards
towards Brine&rsquo;s Rip. After they had gone
about half a mile they rounded a bend and
came in sight of a violent rapid which cut close
inshore. At this point it would be obviously
impossible for any one walking in the shallow
water to avoid coming out upon dry ground.
Tug Blackstock quickened his pace, and waved
Jim forward.</p>
<p>A sharp oath broke from Black Dan&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been an&rsquo; gone an&rsquo; left my &rsquo;baccy-pooch
behind, by the skunk&rsquo;s hole,&rdquo; he announced.
And grumbling under his breath he turned
back down the shore.</p>
<p>Blackstock ran on, as if suddenly in a great
hurry. Just where the shallow water ended,
at the foot of the rapid, Jim gave his signal
with voice and tail. He raced up the bank to
a clump of bushes and began thrashing about
in them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye suppose he&rsquo;s found there?&rdquo;
asked Big Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scent, and lots of it. No mistake this
time,&rdquo; announced MacDonald. &ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t ye
caught on to Jim&rsquo;s signs yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; said the Deputy, sharply but not
loud, &ldquo;<i>fetch him!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim, with nose in air instead of to the ground,
set off at a gallop down the shore in the direction
of the outlet.</p>
<p>The Deputy turned about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; he shouted peremptorily. &ldquo;Come
back here. I want ye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of obeying, Black Dan dashed up
the bank, running like a deer, and vanished
into the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I knew it!</i> That&rsquo;s the skunk, boys. Go
home, you Billy!&rdquo; cried Blackstock, and started
after the fugitive. The rest followed close on
his heels. But Jackson cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;d better call off Jim quick. Dan&rsquo;s got
a gun on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Deputy gave a shrill whistle, and Jim,
who was just vanishing into the bush, stopped
short. At the same instant a shot rang out
from the bushes, and the dog dropped in his
tracks with a howl of anguish.</p>
<p>Blackstock&rsquo;s lean jaws set themselves like
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
iron. He whipped out his own heavy
&ldquo;Colt&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and the party tore on, till they met
Jim dragging himself towards them with a
wounded hind-leg trailing pitifully.</p>
<p>The Deputy gave one look at the big black
dog, heaved a breath of relief, and stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no manner o&rsquo; use chasin&rsquo; him now,
boys,&rdquo; he decreed, &ldquo;because, as we all know,
Dan kin run right away from the best runner
amongst us. But now I know him&mdash;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve
suspicioned him this two month, only I couldn&rsquo;t
git no clue&mdash;<i>I&rsquo;ll git him</i>, never you fear.
Jest now, ye&rsquo;d better help me carry Jim home,
so&rsquo;s we kin git him doctored up in good shape.
I reckon Nipsiwaska County can&rsquo;t afford
to lose Mr. Assistant-Deputy Sheriff. That
there skunk-oil on Dan&rsquo;s moccasins fooled <i>both</i>
Jim an&rsquo; me, good an&rsquo; plenty, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But whatever did he want o&rsquo; my mitts?&rdquo;
demanded Big Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now ye <i>air</i> a sap-head, Andy Stevens,&rdquo;
growled MacDonald, &ldquo;ef ye can&rsquo;t see <i>that</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<h2 id="c4">IV. THE TRAIL OF THE BEAR</h2>
<h3 class="generic">I</h3>
<p>The Deputy Sheriff of Nipsiwaska County
had spent half an hour at the telephone.
In the backwoods the telephone wires go everywhere.
In that half-hour every settlement,
every river-crossing, every lumber-camp, and
most of the wide-scattered pioneer cabins had
been warned of the flight of the thief, Dan
Black, nicknamed Black Dan, and how, in the
effort to secure his escape, he had shot and
wounded the Deputy Sheriff&rsquo;s big black dog
whose cleverness on the trail he had such cause
to dread. As Tug Blackstock, the Deputy
Sheriff, came out of the booth he asked after
Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Black Dan&rsquo;s bullet broke no bones that
time,&rdquo; replied the village doctor, who had
tended the dog&rsquo;s wound as carefully as if his
patient had been the Deputy himself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a biggish hole, but Jim&rsquo;ll be all right in a few
days, never fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackstock looked relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye don&rsquo;t seem to be worryin&rsquo; much about
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
Black Dan&rsquo;s gittin&rsquo; away, Tug,&rdquo; grumbled
Long Jackson, who was not unnaturally sore
over the loss of his money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t worryin&rsquo; much,&rdquo; agreed the
Deputy, with a confident grin, &ldquo;now I know
Jim ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to lose a leg. As for Black
Dan&rsquo;s gittin&rsquo; away, well, I&rsquo;ve got me own
notions about that. I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;phoned all over the
three counties, and given warnin&rsquo; to every
place he kin stop for a bite or a bed.
He can&rsquo;t cross the river to get over the
Border, for I&rsquo;ve sent word to hev every
bridge an&rsquo; ferry watched. Black Dan&rsquo;s cunnin&rsquo;
enough to know I&rsquo;d do jest that, first
thing, so he won&rsquo;t waste his time tryin&rsquo; the
river. He&rsquo;ll strike right back into the big
timber, countin&rsquo; on the start he&rsquo;s got of us,
now he&rsquo;s put Jim out of the game. But I guess
I kin trail him myself&mdash;now I know what
I&rsquo;m trailin&rsquo;&mdash;pretty nigh as well as Jim could.
I&rsquo;ve took note of his tracks, and there ain&rsquo;t
another pair o&rsquo; boots in Brine&rsquo;s Rip Mills like
them he&rsquo;s wearin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when air ye goin&rsquo; to start?&rdquo; demanded
Long Jackson, still inclined to be
resentful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now,&rdquo; replied Blackstock cheerfully,
&ldquo;soon as ye kin git guns and stuff some crackers
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
an&rsquo; cheese into yer pockets. I&rsquo;ll want <i>you</i>
to come along, MacDonald, an&rsquo; you, Long, an&rsquo;
Saunders, an&rsquo; Big Andy, as my posse. Meet
me in fifteen minutes at the store an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll hev
Zeb Smith swear ye in for the job. If Black
Dan wants to do any shootin&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s jest as well
to hev everythin&rsquo; regular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were not a few others among the mill-hands
and the villagers who had lost by Black
Dan&rsquo;s cunning pilferings, and who would
gladly have joined in the hunt. In the backwoods
not even a murderer&mdash;unless his victim
has been a woman or a child&mdash;is hunted
down with so much zest as a thief. But the
Deputy did not like too much volunteer assistance,
and was apt to suppress it with scant
ceremony. So his choice of a posse was accepted
without protest or comment, and the
chosen four slipped off to get their guns.</p>
<p>As Tug Blackstock had foreseen, the trail of
the fugitive was easily picked up. Confident
in his powers as a runaway, Black Dan&rsquo;s sole
object, at first, had been to gain as much lead
as possible over the expected pursuit, and he
had run straight ahead, leaving a trail which
any one of Blackstock&rsquo;s posse&mdash;with the exception,
perhaps, of Big Andy&mdash;could have
followed with almost the speed and precision
of the Deputy himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>There had been no attempt at concealment.
About five miles back, however, in the heavy
woods beyond the head of the Lake, it appeared
that the fugitive had dropped into a walk and
begun to go more circumspectly. The trail
now grew so obscure that the other woodsmen
would have had difficulty in deciphering it at
all, and they were amazed at the ease and confidence
with which Blackstock followed it up,
hardly diminishing his stride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tug is sure some trailer,&rdquo; commented
Jackson, his good humour now quite restored
by the progress they were making.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Jim</i> couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; done no better himself,&rdquo;
declared Big Andy, the Oromocto man.</p>
<p>And just then Blackstock came abruptly to
a halt, and held up his hand for his followers
to stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, boys. Stop right where ye are,
an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t step out o&rsquo; yer tracks,&rdquo; he commanded.</p>
<p>The four stood rigid, and began searching
the ground all about them with keen, initiated
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve got him, so fur, all right,&rdquo; continued
Blackstock, pointing to a particularly
clear and heavy impression of a boot-sole close
behind his own feet. &ldquo;But here it stops. It
don&rsquo;t appear to go any further.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>He knelt down to examine the footprint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps he&rsquo;s doubled back on his tracks, to
throw us off,&rdquo; suggested Saunders, who was
himself an expert on the trails of all the wild
creatures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Blackstock, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve watched
out for that sharp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps he&rsquo;s give a big jump to one side or
t&rsquo;other, to break his trail,&rdquo; said MacDonald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Blackstock with decision, &ldquo;nor
that neither, Mac. This here print is <i>even</i>.
Ef he&rsquo;d jumped to one side or the other, it
would be dug in on that side, and ef he&rsquo;d
jumped forrard, it would be hard down at the
toe. It fair beats me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stepping carefully, foot by foot, he examined
the ground minutely over a half circle of
a dozen yards to his front. He sent out his
followers&mdash;all but Big Andy, who, being no
trailer, was bidden to stand fast&mdash;to either
side and to the rear, crawling like ferrets and
interrogating every grass tuft, in vain. The
trail had simply stopped with that one footprint.
It was as if Black Dan had dissolved
into a miasma, and floated off.</p>
<p>At last Blackstock called the party in, and
around the solitary footprint they all sat down
and smoked. One after another they made
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
suggestions, but each suggestion had its futility
revealed and sealed by a stony stare from
Blackstock, and was no more befriended by
its author.</p>
<p>At last Blackstock rose to his feet, and gave
a hitch to his belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind tellin&rsquo; ye, boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it
beats me fair. But <i>one</i> thing&rsquo;s plain enough,
Black Dan ain&rsquo;t <i>here</i>, an&rsquo; he ain&rsquo;t likely to come
here lookin&rsquo; for us. Spread out now, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll
work on ahead, an&rsquo; see ef we can&rsquo;t pick up
somethin&rsquo;. You, Big Andy, you keep right
along behind me. There&rsquo;s an explanation to
<i>everything</i>&mdash;an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll find this out afore
long, or my name&rsquo;s Dennis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the next three or four hundred yards,
however, nothing of significance was discovered
by any of the party. Then, breaking
through a dense screen of branches, Blackstock
came upon the face of a rocky knoll,
so steep, at that point, that hands and feet
together would be needed to climb it. Casting
his eyes upwards, he saw what looked like
the entrance to a little cave.</p>
<p>A whistle brought the rest of the party to
his side. A cave always holds possibilities,
if nothing else. Blackstock spread his men
out again, at intervals of three or four paces,
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
and all went cautiously up the steep, converging
on the entrance. Blackstock, in the centre,
shielding himself behind a knob of rock, peered
in.</p>
<p>The place was empty. It was hardly a cave,
indeed, being little more than a shallow recess
beneath an overhanging ledge. But it was
well sheltered by a great branch which
stretched upwards across the opening. Blackstock
sniffed critically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bear&rsquo;s den,&rdquo; he announced, stepping in
and scrutinizing the floor.</p>
<p>The floor was naked rock, scantily littered
with dead leaves and twigs. These, Blackstock
concluded, had been recently disturbed,
but he could find no clue to what had disturbed
them. From the further side, however&mdash;to
Blackstock&rsquo;s right&mdash;a palpable trail, worn
clear of moss and herbage, led off by a narrow
ledge across the face of the knoll. Half a
dozen paces further on the rock ended in a
stretch of stiff soil. Here the trail declared
itself. It was unmistakably that of a bear,
and unmistakably, also, a fresh trail.</p>
<p>Waving the rest to stop where they were,
Blackstock followed the clear trail down from
the knoll, and for a couple of hundred yards
along the level, going very slowly, and searching
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
it hawk-eyed for some sign other than that
of bear. At length he returned, looking
slightly crestfallen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nawthin&rsquo; at all but bear,&rdquo; he announced
in an injured voice. &ldquo;But that bear seems to
have been in a bit of a hurry, as if he was
gittin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; somebody&rsquo;s way&mdash;Black Dan&rsquo;s
way, it&rsquo;s dollars to doughnuts. But where
was Black Dan, that&rsquo;s what I want to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ef <i>you</i> don&rsquo;t know, Tug,&rdquo; said MacDonald,
&ldquo;who <i>kin</i> know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim!&rdquo; said the Deputy, rubbing his lean
chin and biting off a big &ldquo;chaw&rdquo; of &ldquo;blackjack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim&rsquo;s sure some dawg,&rdquo; agreed MacDonald.
&ldquo;That was the only fool thing I ever
know&rsquo;d ye to do, Tug&mdash;sendin&rsquo; Jim after
Black Dan that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackstock swore, softly and intensely,
though he was a man not given to that form
of self-expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I used to fancy myself
quite a lot. But now I begin to think Nipsiwaska
County&rsquo;d better be gittin&rsquo; a noo Deputy.
I ain&rsquo;t no manner o&rsquo; good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men looked at him in frank astonishment.
He had never before been seen in this
mood of self-depreciation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, shucks,&rdquo; exclaimed Long Jackson
presently, &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t a man from here to the
St. Lawrence as kin <i>tech</i> ye, an&rsquo; ye know it,
Tug. Quit yer jollyin&rsquo; now. I believe ye&rsquo;ve
got somethin&rsquo; up yer sleeve, only ye won&rsquo;t say
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this expression of unbounded confidence
Blackstock braced up visibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys, there&rsquo;s one thing I <i>kin</i> do,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; back to git Jim, ef I hev
to fetch him in a wheelbarrow. We&rsquo;ll find out
what he thinks o&rsquo; the situation. I&rsquo;ll take
Saunders an&rsquo; Big Andy with me. You, Long,
an&rsquo; Mac, you stop on here an&rsquo; lay low an&rsquo; see
what turns up. But don&rsquo;t go mussin&rsquo; up the
trails.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 class="generic">II</h3>
<p>Jim proved to be so far recovered that he
was able to hobble about a little on three legs,
the fourth being skilfully bandaged so that he
could not put his foot to the ground. It was
obvious, however, that he could not make a
journey through the woods and be any use
whatever at the end of it. Blackstock, therefore,
knocked together a handy litter for his
benefit. And with very ill grace Jim submitted
to being borne upon it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Some twenty paces from that solitary boot-print
which marked the end of Black Dan&rsquo;s
trail, Jim was set free from his litter and his
attention directed to a bruised tuft of moss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seek him,&rdquo; said Blackstock.</p>
<p>The dog gave one sniff, and then with a
growl of anger the hair lifted along his back,
and he limped forward hurriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got it in for Black Dan <i>now</i>,&rdquo; remarked
MacDonald. And the whole party
followed with hopeful expectation, so great
was their faith in Jim&rsquo;s sagacity.</p>
<p>The dog, in his haste, overshot the end of
the trail. He stopped abruptly, whined,
sniffed about, and came back to the deep boot-print.
All about it he circled, whimpering
with impatience, but never going more than a
dozen feet away from it. Then he returned,
sniffed long and earnestly, and stood over it
with drooping tail, evidently quite nonplussed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t appear to make no more of it
than you did, Tug,&rdquo; said Long Jackson, much
disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, give him time, Long,&rdquo; retorted Blackstock.
Then&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seek him! Seek him, good boy,&rdquo; he repeated,
waving Jim to the front.</p>
<p>Running with amazing briskness on his
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
three sound legs, the dog began to quarter the
undergrowth in ever-widening half-circles,
while the men stood waiting and watching.
At last, at a distance of several hundred yards,
he gave a yelp and a growl, and sprang forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got it!&rdquo; exclaimed Big Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess it&rsquo;s only the trail o&rsquo; that there b&rsquo;ar
he&rsquo;s struck,&rdquo; suggested Jackson pessimistically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, stop!&rdquo; ordered Blackstock. And the
dog stood rigid in his tracks while Blackstock
hastened forward to see what he had found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure enough. It&rsquo;s only the bear,&rdquo; cried
Blackstock, investigating the great footprint
over which Jim was standing. &ldquo;Come along
back here, Jim, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t go foolin&rsquo; away yer
time over a bear, jest <i>now</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog sniffed at the trail, gave another
hostile growl, and reluctantly followed his
master back. Blackstock made him smell the
boot-print again. Then he said with emphasis,
&ldquo;<i>Black Dan</i>, Jim, it&rsquo;s <i>Black Dan</i> we&rsquo;re
wantin&rsquo;. Seek him, boy. <i>Fetch him.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim started off on the same man&oelig;uvres as
before, and at the same point as before he
again gave a growl and a yelp and bounded
forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Jim</i>,&rdquo; shouted the Deputy angrily, &ldquo;come
back here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog came limping back, looking puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that foolin&rsquo;?&rdquo; went
on his master severely. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s bears to
you? Smell that!&rdquo; and he pointed again to
the boot-print. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>Black Dan</i> you&rsquo;re after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim hung upon his words, but looked hopelessly
at sea as to his meaning. He turned
and gazed wistfully in the direction of the
bear&rsquo;s trail. He seemed on the point of starting
out for it again, but the tone of Blackstock&rsquo;s
rebuke withheld him. Finally, he sat
down upon his dejected tail and stared upwards
into a great tree, one of whose lower branches
stretched directly over his head.</p>
<p>Blackstock followed his gaze. The tree was
an ancient rock maple, its branches large but
comparatively few in number. Blackstock
could see clear to its top. It was obvious that
the tree could afford no hiding-place to anything
larger than a wild-cat. Nevertheless,
as Blackstock studied it, a gleam of sudden
insight passed over his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim &rsquo;pears to think Black Dan&rsquo;s gone to
Heaven,&rdquo; remarked Saunders drily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye can&rsquo;t always tell <i>what</i> Jim&rsquo;s thinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
retorted Blackstock. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s a clever
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
idea he&rsquo;s got in his black head, whatever it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He scanned the tree anew and the other
trees nearest whose branches interlaced with
it. Then, with a sharp &ldquo;Come on, Jim,&rdquo; he
started towards the knoll, eyeing the branches
overhead as he went. The rest of the party
followed at a discreet distance.</p>
<p>Crippled as he was, Jim could not climb the
steep face of the knoll, but his master helped
him up. The instant he entered the cave he
growled savagely, and once more the stiff hair
rose along his back. Blackstock watched in
silence for a moment. He had never before
noticed, on Jim&rsquo;s part, any special hostility
toward bears, whom he was quite accustomed
to trailing. He glanced up at the big branch
that overhung the entrance, and conviction
settled on his face. Then he whispered,
sharply, &ldquo;Seek him, Jim.&rdquo; And Jim set off at
once, as fast as he could limp, along the trail
of the bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, boys,&rdquo; called Blackstock to his
posse. &ldquo;Ef we can&rsquo;t find Black Dan we may
as well hev a little bear-hunt to fill in the time.
Jim appears to hev a partic&rsquo;lar grudge agin
that bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men closed up eagerly, expecting to find
that Blackstock, with Jim&rsquo;s help, had at last
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
discovered some real signs of Black Dan.
When they saw that there was still nothing
more than that old bear&rsquo;s trail, which they had
already examined, Long Jackson began to
grumble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We kin hunt bear any day,&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess Tug ain&rsquo;t no keener after bear this
day than you be,&rdquo; commented MacDonald.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got <i>somethin&rsquo;</i> up his sleeve, you see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe it&rsquo;s a tame b&rsquo;ar, a <i>trained</i> b&rsquo;ar, an&rsquo;
Black Dan&rsquo;s a-ridin&rsquo; him horseback,&rdquo; suggested
Big Andy.</p>
<p>Blackstock, who was close at Jim&rsquo;s heels, a
few paces ahead of the rest, turned with one
of his rare, ruminative laughs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite an idea of yours, Andy,&rdquo; he
remarked, stooping to examine one of those
great clawed footprints in a patch of soft soil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But even <i>trained</i> b&rsquo;ar hain&rsquo;t got wings,&rdquo;
commented MacDonald again. &ldquo;An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s
a good three hundred yards atween the spot
where Black Dan&rsquo;s trail peters out an&rsquo; the
nearest b&rsquo;ar track. I guess yer interestin&rsquo; hipotheesis
don&rsquo;t quite fill the bill&mdash;eh, Andy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyways,&rdquo; protested the big Oromocto
man, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ll all notice <i>one</i> thing queer about
this here b&rsquo;ar track. It goes <i>straight</i>. Mostly
a b&rsquo;ar will go wanderin&rsquo; off this way an&rsquo; that,
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
to nose at an old root, er grub up a bed o&rsquo; toad-stools.
But <i>this</i> b&rsquo;ar keeps right on, as ef he
had important business somewhere straight
ahead. That&rsquo;s just the way he&rsquo;d go ef some
one <i>was</i> a-ridin&rsquo; him horseback.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy had advanced his proposition as a joke,
but now he was inclined to take it seriously and
to defend it with warmth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Long Jackson, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll all chip
in, when we git our money back, an&rsquo; buy ye a
bear, Andy, an&rsquo; ye shall ride it up every day
from the mills to the post-office. It&rsquo;ll save ye
quite a few minutes in gittin&rsquo; <i>to</i> the post-office.
It don&rsquo;t matter about yer gittin&rsquo; away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big Oromocto lad blushed, but laughed
good-naturedly. He was so much in love with
the little widow who kept the post-office that
nothing pleased him more than to be teased
about her.</p>
<p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s trained eyes, as for Jim&rsquo;s
trained nose, that bear-track was an easy one
to follow. Nevertheless, progress was slow,
for Blackstock would halt from time to time
to interrogate some claw-print with special
minuteness, and from time to time Jim would
stop to lie down and lick gingerly at his bandage,
tormented by the aching of his wound.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon, when the level shadows
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
were black upon the trail and the trailing
had come to depend entirely on Jim&rsquo;s nose,
Blackstock called a halt on the banks of a small
brook and all sat down to eat their bread and
cheese. Then they sprawled about, smoking,
for the Deputy, apparently regarding the chase
as a long one, was now in no great hurry. Jim
lay on the wet sand, close to the brook&rsquo;s edge,
while Blackstock, scooping up the water in
double handfuls, let it fall in an icy stream on
the dog&rsquo;s bandaged leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hev ye got any reel idee to come an&rsquo; go on,
Tug?&rdquo; demanded Long Jackson at last, blowing
a long, slow jet of smoke from his lips, and
watching it spiral upwards across a bar of light
just over his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hev,&rdquo; said Blackstock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; air ye sure it&rsquo;s a good one&mdash;good
enough to drag us &rsquo;way out here on?&rdquo; persisted
Jackson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bankin&rsquo; on it,&rdquo; answered Blackstock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; so&rsquo;s Jim, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; suggested MacDonald,
tentatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim&rsquo;s idee an&rsquo; mine ain&rsquo;t the same, exackly,&rdquo;
vouchsafed Blackstock, after a pause,
&ldquo;but I guess they&rsquo;ll come to the same thing in
the end. They&rsquo;re fittin&rsquo; in with each other
fine, so fur!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll ye bet that ye&rsquo;re not mistaken, the
both o&rsquo; yez?&rdquo; demanded Jackson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yer wages fur the whole summer!&rdquo; answered
Blackstock promptly.</p>
<p>Long looked satisfied. He knocked the
ashes out of his pipe and proceeded to refill it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ef ye&rsquo;re so sure as that, Tug,&rdquo; he
drawled, &ldquo;I guess I ain&rsquo;t takin&rsquo; any this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a couple of hours after sunset the party
continued to follow the trail, depending now
entirely upon Jim&rsquo;s leadership. The dog, revived
by his rest and his master&rsquo;s cold-water
treatment, limped forward at a good pace,
growling from time to time as a fresh pang in
his wound reminded him anew of his enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How Jim &rsquo;pears to hate that bear!&rdquo; remarked
Big Andy once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does <i>that</i>!&rdquo; agreed Blackstock. &ldquo;An&rsquo;
he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to git his own back, too, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;,
afore long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently the moon rose round and yellow
through the tree-tops, and the going became
less laborious. Jim seemed untiring now. He
pressed on so eagerly that Blackstock concluded
the object of his vindictive pursuit, whatever
it was, must be now not far ahead.</p>
<p>Another hour, and the party came out suddenly
upon the bank of a small pond. Jim,
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
his nose to earth, started to lead the way
around it, towards the left. But Blackstock
stopped him, and halted his party in the dense
shadows.</p>
<p>The opposite shore was in the full glare of
the moonlight. There, close to the water&rsquo;s
edge, stood a little log hut, every detail of it
standing out as clearly as in daylight. It was
obviously old, but the roof had been repaired
with new bark and poles and the door was shut,
instead of sagging half open on broken hinges
after the fashion of the doors of deserted
cabins.</p>
<p>Blackstock slipped a leash from his pocket
and clipped it onto Jim&rsquo;s collar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;, boys, we&rsquo;ll git some information
yonder about that bear, ef we go the right
way about inquirin&rsquo;. Now, Saunders, you go
round the pond to the right and steal up along-shore,
through the bushes, to within forty
paces of the hut. You, Mac, an&rsquo; Big Andy,
you two go round same way, but git well back
into the timber, and come up <i>behind</i> the hut to
within about the same distance. There&rsquo;ll be
a winder on that side, likely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When ye&rsquo;re in position give the call o&rsquo; the
big horned owl, not too loud. An&rsquo; when I
answer with the same call twice, then close in.
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
But keep a good-sized tree atween you an&rsquo; the
winder, for ye never know what a bear kin do
when he&rsquo;s trained. I&rsquo;ll bet Big Andy&rsquo;s seen
bears that could shoulder a gun like a man!
So look out for yourselves. Long an&rsquo; Jim an&rsquo;
me, we&rsquo;ll follow the trail o&rsquo; the bear right round
this end o&rsquo; the pond&mdash;an&rsquo; ef I&rsquo;m not mistaken
it&rsquo;ll lead us right up to the door o&rsquo; that there
hut. Some bears hev a taste in regard to
where they sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As noiselessly as shadows the party melted
away in opposite directions.</p>
<p>The pond lay smooth as glass under the
flooding moonlight, reflecting a pale star or
two where the moon-path grudgingly gave it
space.</p>
<p>After some fifteen minutes a lazy, muffled
hooting floated across the pond. Five minutes
later the same call, the very voice of the
wilderness at midnight, came from the deep
of the woods behind the hut.</p>
<p>Blackstock, with Jackson close behind him
and Jim pulling eagerly on the leash, was now
within twenty yards of the hut door, but hidden
behind a thick young fir tree. He breathed
the call of the horned owl&mdash;a mellow, musical
call, which nevertheless brings terror to all the
small creatures of the wilderness&mdash;and then,
after a pause, repeated it softly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>He waited for a couple of minutes motionless.
His keen ears caught the snapping of a
twig close behind the hut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big Andy&rsquo;s big feet that time,&rdquo; he muttered
to himself. &ldquo;That boy&rsquo;ll never be much
good on the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, leaving Jim to the care of Jackson, he
slipped forward to another and bigger tree not
more than a dozen paces from the cabin.
Standing close in the shadow of the trunk, and
drawing his revolver, he called sharply as a
gun-shot&mdash;&ldquo;Dan Black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly there was a thud within the hut as
of some one leaping from a bunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan Black,&rdquo; repeated the Deputy, &ldquo;the
game&rsquo;s up. I&rsquo;ve got ye surrounded. Will ye
come out quietly an&rsquo; give yerself up, or do ye
want trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waal, no, I guess I don&rsquo;t want no more
trouble,&rdquo; drawled a cool voice from within the
hut. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ve got enough o&rsquo; my own
already. I&rsquo;ll come out, Tug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door was flung open, and Black Dan,
with his hands held up, stalked forth into the
moonlight.</p>
<p>With a roar Jim sprang out from behind
the fir tree, dragging Long Jackson with him
by the sudden violence of his rush.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;Down, Jim, <i>down</i>!&rdquo; ordered Blackstock.
&ldquo;Lay down an&rsquo; shut up.&rdquo; And Jim, grumbling
in his throat, allowed Jackson to pull him
back by the collar.</p>
<p>Blackstock advanced and clicked the handcuffs
on to Black Dan&rsquo;s wrists. Then he took
the revolver and knife from the prisoner&rsquo;s belt,
and motioned him back into the hut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bein&rsquo; pretty late now,&rdquo; said Blackstock,
&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll accept yer hospitality for the
rest o&rsquo; the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right ye are, Tug,&rdquo; assented Dan. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll
find tea an&rsquo; merlasses, an&rsquo; a bite o&rsquo; bacon in
the cupboard yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the rest of the party came in Black Dan
nodded to them cordially, a greeting which they
returned with more or less sheepish grins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me ef I don&rsquo;t shake hands with ye,
boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but Tug here says the state
o&rsquo; me health makes it bad for me to use me
arms.&rdquo; And he held up the handcuffs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No apologies needed,&rdquo; said MacDonald.</p>
<p>Last of all came in Long Jackson, with Jim.
Blackstock slipped the leash, and the dog lay
down in a corner, as far from the prisoner as
he could get.</p>
<p>In a few minutes the whole party were sitting
about the tiny stove, drinking boiled tea
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
and munching crackers and molasses&mdash;the
prisoner joining in the feast as well as his
manacled hands would permit. At length,
with his mouth full of cracker, the Deputy
remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was clever of ye, Dan&mdash;durn&rsquo;
clever. I didn&rsquo;t know it was in ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not half so clever as you seein&rsquo; through
it the way you did, Tug,&rdquo; responded the prisoner
handsomely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But darned ef <i>I</i> see through it <i>now</i>,&rdquo; protested
Big Andy in a plaintive voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
just about as clear as mud to <i>me</i>. Where&rsquo;s
your wings, Dan? An&rsquo; where in tarnation is
that b&rsquo;ar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prisoner laughed triumphantly. Long
Jackson and the others looked relieved, the
Oromocto man having propounded the question
which they had been ashamed to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s jest this way,&rdquo; explained Blackstock.
&ldquo;When we&rsquo;d puzzled Jim yonder&mdash;an&rsquo; he <i>was</i>
puzzled at us bein&rsquo; such fools&mdash;ye&rsquo;ll recollect
he sat down on his tail by that boot-print, an&rsquo;
tried to work out what we wanted of him. I
was tellin&rsquo; him to seek Black Dan, an&rsquo; yet I
was callin&rsquo; him back off that there bear-track.
<i>He</i> could smell Black Dan in the bear-track,
but we couldn&rsquo;t. So we was doin&rsquo; the best we
could to mix him up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he looked up into the big maple overhead.
Then I saw where Black Dan had gone
to. He&rsquo;d jumped (that&rsquo;s why the boot-print
was so heavy), an&rsquo; caught that there branch,
an&rsquo; swung himself up into the tree. Then he
worked his way along from tree to tree till he
come to the cave. I saw by the way Jim took
on in the cave that Black Dan had been <i>there</i>
all right. For Jim hain&rsquo;t got no special grudge
agin bear. Says I to myself, ef Jim smells
Black Dan in that bear trail, then Black Dan
must <i>be</i> in it, that&rsquo;s all!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it comes over me that I&rsquo;d once seen a
big bear-skin in Dan&rsquo;s room at the Mills, an&rsquo;
as the picture of it come up agin in my mind,
I noticed how the fore-paws and legs of it were
missin&rsquo;. With that I looked agin at the trail,
as we went along, Jim an&rsquo; me. An&rsquo; sure
enough, in all them tracks there wasn&rsquo;t one
print of a hind-paw. <i>They were all fore-paws.</i>
Smart, very smart o&rsquo; Dan, says I to
myself. Let&rsquo;s see them ingenious socks o&rsquo;
yours, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re in the top bunk yonder,&rdquo; said
Black Dan, with a weary air. &ldquo;An&rsquo; my belt
and pouch, containin&rsquo; the other stuff, that&rsquo;s all
in the bunk, too. I may&rsquo;s well save ye the
trouble o&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; for it, as ye&rsquo;d find it anyways.
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
I was <i>sure</i> ye&rsquo;d never succeed in trackin&rsquo; me
down, so I didn&rsquo;t bother to hide it. An&rsquo; I see
now ye <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> &rsquo;a&rsquo; got me, Tug, ef it hadn&rsquo;t
&rsquo;a&rsquo; been fer Jim. That&rsquo;s where I made the mistake
o&rsquo; my life, not stoppin&rsquo; to make sure I&rsquo;d
done Jim up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dan,&rdquo; said Blackstock, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;re wrong
there. Ef you&rsquo;d done Jim up I&rsquo;d have caught
ye jest the same, in the long run, fer I&rsquo;d never
have quit the trail till I <i>did</i> git ye. An&rsquo; when
I got ye&mdash;well, I&rsquo;d hev forgot myself, mebbe,
an&rsquo; only remembered that ye&rsquo;d killed my best
friend. Ef ye&rsquo;d had as many lives as a cat,
Dan, they wouldn&rsquo;t hev been enough to pay
fer that dawg.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c5">V. THE FIRE AT BRINE&rsquo;S RIP MILLS</h2>
<h3 class="generic">I</h3>
<p>When pretty Mary Farrell came to
Brine&rsquo;s Rip and set up a modest dressmaker&rsquo;s
shop quite close to the Mills (she said
she loved the sound of the saws), all the unattached
males of the village, to say nothing of
too many of the attached ones, fell instant victims
to her charms. They were her slaves
from the first lifting of her long lashes in their
direction.</p>
<p>Tug Blackstock, the Deputy Sheriff, to be
sure, did not capitulate quite so promptly as
the rest. Mary had to flash her dark blue
eyes upon him at least twice, dropping them
again with shy admiration. Then he was at
her feet&mdash;which was a pleasant place to be,
seeing that those same small feet were shod
with a neatness which was a perpetual reproach
to the untidy sawdust strewn roadways of
Brine&rsquo;s Rip.</p>
<p>Even Big Andy, the boyish young giant
from the Oromocto, wavered for a few hours
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
in his allegiance to the postmistress. But
Mary was much too tactful to draw upon her
pretty shoulders the hostility of such a power
as the postmistress, and Big Andy&rsquo;s enthusiasm
was cold-douched in its first glow.</p>
<p>As for the womenfolk of Brine&rsquo;s Rip, it was
not to be expected that they would agree any
too cordially with the men on the subject of
Mary Farrell.</p>
<p>But one instance of Mary&rsquo;s tact made even
the most irreconcilable of her own sex sheath
their claws in dealing with her. She had come
from Harner&rsquo;s Bend. The Mills at Harner&rsquo;s
Bend were anathema to Brine&rsquo;s Rip Mills. A
keen trade rivalry had grown, fed by a series
of petty but exasperating incidents, into a hostility
that blazed out on the least occasion.
And pretty Mary had come from Harner&rsquo;s
Bend. Brine&rsquo;s Rip did not find it out till Mary&rsquo;s
spell had been cast and secured, of course.
But the fact was a bitter one to swallow. No
one else but Mary Farrell could have made
Brine&rsquo;s Rip swallow it.</p>
<p>One day Big Andy, greatly daring, and
secure in his renovated allegiance to the postmistress,
ventured to chaff Mary about it.
She turned upon him, half amused and half
indignant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she demanded, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t Harner&rsquo;s
Bend a good place to come away from? Do
you think I&rsquo;d ought to have stopped there? Do
I look like the kind of girl that <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> come
away from Harner&rsquo;s Bend? And me a dressmaker?
I just couldn&rsquo;t <i>live</i>, let alone make a
living, among such a dowdy lot of women-folk
as they&rsquo;ve got over there. It isn&rsquo;t dresses <i>they</i>
want, but oat-sacks, and you wouldn&rsquo;t know
the difference, either, when they&rsquo;d got them
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The implication was obvious; and the women
of Brine&rsquo;s Rip began to allow for possible virtues
in Miss Farrell. The postmistress declared
there was no harm in her, and even
admitted that she might almost be called good-looking
&ldquo;if she hadn&rsquo;t such an <i>awful</i> big
mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have said that all the male folk of Brine&rsquo;s
Rip had capitulated immediately to the summons
of Mary Farrell&rsquo;s eyes. But there were
two notable exceptions&mdash;Woolly Billy and
Jim. Both Woolly Billy&rsquo;s flaxen mop of curls
and the great curly black head of Jim, the dog,
had turned away coldly from Mary&rsquo;s first
advances. Woolly Billy preferred men to
women anyhow. And Jim was jealous of Tug
Blackstock&rsquo;s devotion to the petticoated
stranger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>But Mary Farrell knew how to manage children
and dogs as well as men. She ignored
both Jim and Woolly Billy. She did it quite
pointedly, yet with a gracious politeness that
left no room for resentment. Neither the
child nor the dog was accustomed to being ignored.
Before long Mary&rsquo;s amiable indifference
began to make them feel as if they were
being left out in the cold. They began to think
they were losing something because she did
not notice them. Reluctantly at first, but
by-and-by with eagerness, they courted her
attention. At last they gained it. It was
undeniably pleasant. From that moment the
child and the dog were at Mary&rsquo;s well-shod and
self-reliant little feet.</p>
<h3 class="generic">II</h3>
<p>As summer wore on into autumn the dry
weather turned to a veritable drought, and all
the streams ran lower and lower. Word came
early that the mills at Harner&rsquo;s Bend, over in
the next valley, had been compelled to shut
down for lack of logs. But Brine&rsquo;s Rip exulted
unkindly. The Ottanoonsis, fed by a
group of cold spring lakes, maintained a steady
flow; there were plenty of logs, and the mills
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
had every prospect of working full time all
through the autumn. Presently they began to
gather in big orders which would have gone
otherwise to Harner&rsquo;s Bend. Brine&rsquo;s Rip not
only exulted, but took into itself merit. It
felt that it must, on general principles, have
deserved well of Providence, for Providence
so obviously to take sides with it.</p>
<p>As August drew to a dusty, choking end,
Mary Farrell began to collect her accounts.
Her tact and sympathy made this easy for her,
and women paid up civilly enough who had
never been known to do such a thing before,
unless at the point of a summons. Mary said
she was going to the States, perhaps as far as
New York itself, to renew her stock and study
up the latest fashions.</p>
<p>Every one was much interested. Woolly
Billy&rsquo;s eyes brimmed over at the prospect of
her absence, but he was consoled by the promise
of her speedy return <i>with</i> an air-gun and
also a toy steam-engine that would really go.
As for Jim, his feathery black tail drooped in
premonition of a loss, but he could not gather
exactly what was afoot. He was further
troubled by an unusual depression on the
part of Tug Blackstock. The Deputy Sheriff
seemed to have lost his zest in tracking down
evil-doers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>It was nearing ten o&rsquo;clock on a hot and starless
night. Tug Blackstock, too restless to
sleep, wandered down to the silent mill with
Jim at his heels. As he approached, Jim suddenly
went bounding on ahead with a yelp of
greeting. He fawned upon a small, shadowy
figure which was seated on a pile of deals close
to the water&rsquo;s edge. Tug Blackstock hurried
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You here, Mary, all alone, at this time o&rsquo;
night!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come here often,&rdquo; answered Mary, making
room for him to sit beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d known it sooner,&rdquo; muttered the
Deputy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like to listen to the rapids, and catch
glimpses of the water slipping away blindly
in the dark,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;It helps one not
to think,&rdquo; she added with a faint catch in her
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should <i>you</i> not want to think,
Mary?&rdquo; protested Blackstock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dreadfully dry everything is,&rdquo; replied
Mary irrelevantly, as if heading Blackstock
off. &ldquo;What if there should be a fire at
the mill? Wouldn&rsquo;t the whole village go, like
a box of matches? People might get caught
asleep in their beds. Oughtn&rsquo;t there to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
more than one night watchman in such dry
weather as this? I&rsquo;ve so often heard of mills
catching fire&mdash;though I don&rsquo;t see why they
should, any more than houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mills most generally git <i>set</i> afire,&rdquo; answered
the Deputy grimly. &ldquo;Think what it
would mean to Harner&rsquo;s Bend if these mills
should git burnt down now! It would mean
thousands and thousands to them. But you&rsquo;re
dead right, Mary, about the danger to the
village. Only it depends on the wind. This
time o&rsquo; year, an&rsquo; as long as it keeps dry, what
wind there is blows mostly <i>away</i> from the
houses, so sparks and brands would just be
carried out over the river. But if the wind
should shift to the south&rsquo;ard, or thereabouts,
yes, there&rsquo;d be more watchmen needed. I
s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;re thinkin&rsquo; about your shop while
ye&rsquo;re away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking about Woolly Billy,&rdquo; said
Mary gravely. &ldquo;What do I care about the
old shop? It&rsquo;s insured, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look out for Woolly Billy,&rdquo; answered
Blackstock. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll look out for the shop,
whether <i>you</i> care about it or not. It&rsquo;s yours,
and your name&rsquo;s on the door, and anything of
yours, anything you&rsquo;ve touched, an&rsquo; wherever
you&rsquo;ve put your little foot, that&rsquo;s something for
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
me to care about. I ain&rsquo;t no hand at making
pretty speeches, Mary, or paying compliments,
but I tell you these here old sawdust roads are
just wonderful to me now, because your little
feet have walked on &rsquo;em. Ef only I could
think that <i>you</i> could care&mdash;that I had anything,
<i>was</i> anything, Mary, worth offering
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had taken her hand, and she had yielded
it to him. He had put his great arm around
her shoulders and drawn her to him,&mdash;and for
a moment, with a little shiver, she had leant
against him, almost cowered against him, with
the air of a frightened child craving protection.
But as he spoke on, in his quiet, strong
voice, she suddenly tore herself away, sprang
off to the other end of the pile of deals, and
began to sob violently.</p>
<p>He followed her at once. But she thrust
out both hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away. <i>Please</i> don&rsquo;t come near me,&rdquo;
she appealed, somewhat wildly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
understand&mdash;<i>anything</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tug Blackstock looked puzzled. He seated
himself at a distance of several inches, and
clasped his hands resolutely in his lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I won&rsquo;t tech you, Mary,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t want me to. I don&rsquo;t want
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
to do <i>anything</i> you don&rsquo;t want me to&mdash;<i>never</i>,
Mary. But I sure don&rsquo;t understand what
you&rsquo;re crying for. <i>Please</i> don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m so sorry
I teched you, dear. But if you knew how I
love you, how I would give my life for you,
I think you&rsquo;d forgive me, Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary gave a bitter little laugh, and choked
her sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that, oh no, it isn&rsquo;t <i>that</i>!&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I&mdash;I <i>liked</i> it. There!&rdquo; she panted.
Then she sprang to her feet and faced him.
And in the gloom he could see her eyes flaming
with some intense excitement, from a face
ghost-white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;I won&rsquo;t let you make me love
you, Tug Blackstock. I won&rsquo;t!&mdash;I won&rsquo;t! I
won&rsquo;t let you change all my plans, all my
ambitions. I won&rsquo;t give up all I&rsquo;ve worked
for and schemed for and sold my very soul
for, just because at last I&rsquo;ve met a real man.
Oh, I&rsquo;d soon spoil your life, no matter how
much you love me. You&rsquo;d soon find how cruel,
and hard, and selfish I am. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;d ruin my
own life, too. Do you think I could settle
down to spend my life in the backwoods? Do
you think I have no dreams beyond the spruce
woods of Nipsiwaska County? Do you think
you could imprison <i>me</i> in Brine&rsquo;s Rip? I&rsquo;d
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
either kill your brave, clean soul, Tug Blackstock,
or I&rsquo;d kill myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Utterly bewildered at this incomprehensible
outburst, Blackstock could only stammer
lamely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;I thought&mdash;ye kind o&rsquo; liked Brine&rsquo;s
Rip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Like</i> it!&rdquo; The uttermost of scorn was in
her voice. &ldquo;I hate, hate, hate it! I just live to
get out into the great world, where I feel that
I belong. But I must have money first. And
I&rsquo;m going to study, and I&rsquo;m going to make
myself somebody. I wasn&rsquo;t born for this.&rdquo;
And she waved her hand with a sweep that
took in all the backwoods world. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting
out of it. It would drive me mad. Oh, I
sometimes think it has already driven me half
mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her tense voice trailed off wearily, and she
sat down again&mdash;this time further away.</p>
<p>Blackstock sat quite still for a time. At last
he said gently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do understand ye now, Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>don&rsquo;t</i>,&rdquo; interrupted Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt, all along, I was somehow not good
enough for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a million miles <i>too</i> good for me,&rdquo;
she interrupted again, energetically.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he went on without heeding the protest,
&ldquo;I hoped, somehow, that I might be able
to make you happy. An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s what I want,
more&rsquo;n anything else in the world. All I have
is at your feet, Mary, an&rsquo; I could make it more
in time. But I&rsquo;m not a big enough man for
you. I&rsquo;m all yours&mdash;an&rsquo; always will be&mdash;but
I can&rsquo;t make myself no more than I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you could, Tug Blackstock,&rdquo; she
cried. &ldquo;Real men are scarce, in the great
world and everywhere. You could make yourself
a master anywhere&mdash;if only you would
tear yourself loose from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang up, and his arms went out as if
to seize her. But, with an effort, he checked
himself, and dropped them stiffly to his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too old to change my spots, Mary,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stamped for good an&rsquo; all. I
<i>am</i> some good here. I&rsquo;d be no good there.
An&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t never resk bein&rsquo; a drag on yer
plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could&mdash;you could!&rdquo; urged Mary
almost desperately.</p>
<p>But he turned away, with his lips set hard,
not daring to look at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ef ever ye git tired of it all out there, an&rsquo;
yer own kind calls ye back&mdash;as it will, bein&rsquo;
in yer blood&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be waitin&rsquo; for ye, Mary,
whatever happens.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>He strode off quickly up the shore. The
girl stared after him till he was quite out of
sight, then buried her face in the fur of Jim,
who had willingly obeyed a sign from his master
and remained at her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear, if only you could have
dared,&rdquo; she murmured. At last she jumped
up, with an air of resolve, and wandered off,
apparently aimlessly, into the recesses of the
mill, with one hand resting firmly on Jim&rsquo;s
collar.</p>
<h3 class="generic">III</h3>
<p>Two days later Mary Farrell left Brine&rsquo;s
Rip. She hugged and kissed Woolly Billy
very hard before she left, and cried a little
with him, pretending to laugh, and she took
her three big trunks with her, in the long-bodied
express waggon which carried the
mails, although she said she would not be gone
more than a month at the outside.</p>
<p>Tug Blackstock eyed those three trunks
with a sinking heart. His only comfort was
that he had in his pocket the key of Mary&rsquo;s
little shop, which she had sent to him by Woolly
Billy. When the express waggon had rattled
and bumped away out of sight there was a
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
general feeling in Brine&rsquo;s Rip that the whole
place had gone flat, like stale beer, and the
saws did not seem to make as cheerful a shrieking
as before, and Black Saunders, expert
runner of logs as he was, fell in because he
forgot to look where he was going, and
knocked his head heavily in falling, and was
almost drowned before they could fish him out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be some bad luck comin&rsquo;
to Brine&rsquo;s Rip afore long,&rdquo; remarked Long
Jackson in a voice of deepest pessimism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s come, Long,&rdquo; said the Deputy.</p>
<p>That same day the wind changed, and blew
steadily from the mills right across the village.
But it brought no change in the weather,
except a few light showers that did no more
than lay the surface dust. About a week later
it shifted back again, and blew steadily away
from the village and straight across the river.
And once more a single night-watchman was
regarded as sufficient safeguard against fire.</p>
<p>A little before daybreak on the second night
following this change of wind, the watchman
was startled by a shrill scream and a heavy
splash from the upper end of the great pool
where the logs were gathered before being
fed up in the saws. It sounded like a woman&rsquo;s
voice. As fast as he could stumble over the
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
intervening deals and rubbish he made his way
to the spot, waving his lantern and calling
anxiously. There was no sign of any one in
the water. As he searched he became conscious
of a ruddy light at one corner of the
mill.</p>
<p>He turned and dashed back, yelling &ldquo;Fire!
Fire!&rdquo; at the top of his lungs. A similar
ruddy light was spreading upward in two other
corners of the mill. Frantically he turned on
the nearest chemical extinguisher, yelling
madly all the while. But he was already too
late. The flames were licking up the dry
wood with furious appetite.</p>
<p>In almost as little time as it takes to tell of
it the whole great structure was ablaze, with
all Brine&rsquo;s Rip, in every varying stage of
<i>d&eacute;shabille</i>, out gaping at it. The little hand-fire-engine
worked heroically, squirting a
futile stream upon the flames for a while, and
then turning its attention to the nearest houses
in order to keep them drenched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God the wind&rsquo;s in the right direction,&rdquo;
muttered Zeb Smith, the storekeeper and
magistrate. And the pious ejaculation was
echoed fervently through the crowd.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Tug Blackstock, seeing that
there was nothing to do in the way of fighting
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
the fire&mdash;the mill being already devoured&mdash;was
interviewing the distracted watchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;it <i>was</i> a trick to git
you away long enough for the fires to git a
start. Somebody yelled, an&rsquo; chucked in a big
stick, that&rsquo;s all. An&rsquo;, o&rsquo; course, you run to
help. You couldn&rsquo;t naturally do nothin&rsquo; else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The watchman heaved a huge sigh of relief.
If Blackstock exonerated him from the charge
of negligence, other people would. And his
heart had been very heavy at being so fatally
fooled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Harner&rsquo;s Bend all right, that&rsquo;s what
it is!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ef only we could prove it,&rdquo; said Blackstock,
searching the damp ground about the
edges of the pool, which was lighted now as
by day. Presently he saw Jim sniffing excitedly
at some tracks. He hurried over to
examine them. Jim looked up at him and
wagged his tail, as much as to say, &ldquo;So <i>you&rsquo;ve</i>
found them, too! Interesting, ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye make o&rsquo; that?&rdquo; demanded
Blackstock of the watchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Boy&rsquo;s</i> tracks, sure,&rdquo; said the latter at once.</p>
<p>The footprints were small and neat. They
were of a double-soled larrigan, with a low
heel of a single welt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;None of <i>our</i> boys,&rdquo; said Blackstock, &ldquo;wear
a larrigan like that, especially this time o&rsquo; year.
One could run light in that larrigan, an&rsquo; the
sole&rsquo;s thick enough to save the foot. An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
good for a canoe, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rubbed his chin, thinking hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday,&rdquo; said the watchman, &ldquo;I mind
seem&rsquo; a young half-breed, he looked like a slip
of a lad, very dark complected, crossin&rsquo; the
road half-a-mile up yonder. He was out o&rsquo;
sight in a second, like a shadder, but I mind
noticin&rsquo; he had on larrigans&mdash;an&rsquo; a brown
slouch hat down over his eyes, an&rsquo; a dark red
handkerchief roun&rsquo; his neck. He was a
stranger in these parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would account for the voice, like a
woman&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Blackstock, following the
tracks till they plunged through a tangle of
tall bush. &ldquo;An&rsquo; here&rsquo;s the handkerchief,&rdquo; he
added triumphantly, grabbing up a dark red
thing that fluttered from a branch. &ldquo;Harner&rsquo;s
Bend knows somethin&rsquo; about that boy,
I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;. Now, Bill, you go along back,
an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo; about this, <i>mind</i>! Me
an&rsquo; Jim, we&rsquo;ll look into it. Tell old Mrs. Amos
and Woolly Billy not to fret. We&rsquo;ll be back
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slipped the leash into Jim&rsquo;s collar, gave
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
him the red handkerchief to smell, and said,
&ldquo;Seek him, Jim.&rdquo; And Jim set off eagerly,
tugging at the leash, because the trail was so
fresh and plain to him, and he hated to be held
back.</p>
<p>The trail led around behind the village, and
back to the river bank about a mile below.
There it followed straight down the shore. It
was evident to Blackstock that his quarry
would have a canoe in hiding some distance
further down. There was no time to be lost.
It was now almost full daybreak, and he could
follow the trail by himself. After all, it was
only a boy he had to deal with. He could
trust Jim to delay him, to hold him at bay. He
loosed the leash, and Jim bounded forward at
top speed. He himself followed at a leisurely
loping stride.</p>
<p>As he trotted on, thinking of many things,
he took out the red handkerchief and examined
it again. He smelt it curiously. His
nose was keen, like a wild animal&rsquo;s. As he
sniffed, a pang went through him, clutching
at his heart. He sniffed again. His long
stride shortened. He dropped into a walk.
He thought over, word by word, his conversation
with Mary that night beside the mill. His
face went grey. After a brief struggle he
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
shouted to Jim, trying to call him back. But
the eager dog was already far beyond hearing.
Then Blackstock broke into a desperate run,
shouting from time to time. He thought of
Jim&rsquo;s ferocity when on the trail.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the figure of a slim boy, very
light of foot, was speeding far down the river
bank, clutching a brown slouch hat in one hand
as he ran. He had an astonishing crop of hair,
wound in tight coils about his head. He was
panting heavily, and seemed nearly spent. At
last he halted, drew a deep sigh of relief,
pressed his hands to his heart, and plunged
into a clump of bushes. In the depth of the
bushes lay a small birch-bark canoe, carefully
concealed. He tugged at it, but for the moment
he was too weary to lift it. He flung
himself down beside it to take breath.</p>
<p>In the silence, his ears caught the sound of
light feet padding down the shore. He
jumped up, and peered through the bushes.
A big black dog was galloping on his trail.
He drew a long knife, and his mouth set itself
so hard that the lips went white. The dog
reached the edge of the bushes. The youth
slipped behind the canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; said he softly. The dog whined,
wagged his tail, and plunged in through the
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
bushes. The youth&rsquo;s stern lips relaxed. He
slipped the knife back into its sheath, and
fondled the dog, which was fawning upon him
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d never go back on me, would you,
Jim, no matter what I&rsquo;d done?&rdquo; said he, in a
gentle voice. Then, with an expert twist of
his lithe young body, he shouldered the canoe
and bore it down to the water&rsquo;s edge. One of
his swarthy hands had suddenly grown much
whiter, where Jim had been licking it.</p>
<p>Before stepping into the canoe, this peculiar
youth took a scrap of paper from his shirt
pocket, and an envelope. He scribbled something,
sealed it up, addressed the envelope,
marked it &ldquo;private,&rdquo; and gave it to Jim, who
took it in his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give that to Tug Blackstock,&rdquo; ordered the
youth clearly. Then he kissed the top of Jim&rsquo;s
black head, pushed off, and paddled away
swiftly down river. Jim, proud of his commission,
set off up the shore at a gallop to
meet his master.</p>
<p>Half-a-mile back he met him. Blackstock
snatched the letter from Jim&rsquo;s mouth, praising
Heaven that the dog had for once
failed in his duty. He tore open the letter.
It said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p class="bq">Yes, I did it. I had to do it. But <i>you</i> could have
saved me, if you&rsquo;d <i>dared</i>&mdash;for I do love you, Tug
Blackstock.&mdash;<span class="sc">Mary.</span></p>
<p>A month later, a parcel came from New
York for Woolly Billy, containing an air-gun,
and a toy steam-engine that would really go.
But it contained no address. And Brine&rsquo;s Rip
said that Tug Blackstock had been bested for
once, because he never succeeded in finding out
who burnt down the mills.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<h2 id="c6">VI. THE MAN WITH THE DANCING BEAR</h2>
<h3 class="generic">I</h3>
<p>One day there arrived at Brine&rsquo;s Rip Mills,
driving in a smart trap which looked
peculiarly unsuited to the rough backwoods
roads, an imposing gentleman who wore a
dark green Homburg hat, heavy, tan, gauntleted
gloves, immaculate linen, shining boots,
and a well-fitting morning suit of dark pepper-and-salt,
protected from the contaminations of
travel by a long, fawn-coloured dust-coat. He
also wore a monocle so securely screwed into
his left eye that it looked as if it had been born
there.</p>
<p>His red and black wheels labouring noiselessly
through the sawdust of the village road,
he drove up to the front door of the barn-like
wooden structure, which staggered under the
name, in huge letters, of the CONTINENTAL
HOTEL. There was no one in sight to hold
the horse, so he sat in the trap and waited, with
severe impatience, for some one to come out
to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>In a few moments the landlord strolled forth
in his shirt-sleeves, chewing tobacco, and
inquired casually what he could do for his
visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for Mr. Blackstock&mdash;Mr. J.
T. Blackstock,&rdquo; said the stranger with lofty
politeness. &ldquo;Will you be so good as to direct
me to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlord spat thoughtfully into the sawdust,
to show that he was not unduly impressed
by the stranger&rsquo;s appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find him down to the furder end of
the cross street yonder,&rdquo; he answered, pointing
with his thumb. &ldquo;Last house towards the
river. Lives with old Mrs. Amos&mdash;him an&rsquo;
Woolly Billy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger found it without difficulty, and
halted his trap in front of the door. Before
he could alight, a tall, rather gaunt woodsman,
with kind but piercing eyes and brows knitted
in an habitual concentration, appeared in the
doorway and gave him courteous greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Blackstock, I presume? The Deputy
Sheriff, I should say,&rdquo; returned the stranger
with extreme affability, descending from the
trap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; assented Blackstock, stepping
forward to hitch the horse to a fence post. A
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
big black dog came from the house and,
ignoring the resplendent stranger, went up to
Blackstock&rsquo;s side to superintend the hitching.
A slender little boy, with big china-blue eyes
and a shock of pale, flaxen curls, followed the
dog from the house and stopped to stare at the
visitor.</p>
<p>The latter swept the child with a glance of
scrutiny, swift and intent, then turned to his
host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am extraordinarily glad to meet you, Mr.
Blackstock,&rdquo; he said, holding out his hand.
&ldquo;If, as I surmise, the name of this little boy
here is Master George Harold Manners Watson,
then I owe you a debt of gratitude which
nothing can repay. I hear that you not only
saved his life, but have been as a father to
him, ever since the death of his own unhappy
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blackstock&rsquo;s heart contracted. He accepted
the stranger&rsquo;s hand cordially enough, but was
in no hurry to reply. At last he said slowly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Stranger, you&rsquo;ve got Woolly Billy&rsquo;s
reel name all O. K. But why should <i>you</i> thank
me? Whatever I&rsquo;ve done, it&rsquo;s been for Woolly
Billy&rsquo;s own sake&mdash;ain&rsquo;t it, Billy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer, Woolly Billy snuggled up
against his side and clutched his great brown
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
hand adoringly, while still keeping dubious
eyes upon the stranger.</p>
<p>The latter took off his gloves, laughing
amiably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, Mr. Blackstock, I&rsquo;m only
his uncle, and his only uncle at that. So I
have a right to thank you, and I see by the way
the child clings to you how good you&rsquo;ve been
to him. My name is J. Heathington Johnson,
of Heathington Hall, Cramley, Blankshire.
I&rsquo;m his mother&rsquo;s brother. And I fear I shall
have to tear him away from you in a great
hurry, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come inside, Mr. Johnson,&rdquo; said Blackstock,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; sit down. We must talk this over
a bit. It is kind o&rsquo; sudden, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to seem unsympathetic,&rdquo; said
the visitor kindly, &ldquo;and I know my little
nephew is going to resent my carrying him
off.&rdquo; (At these words Woolly Billy began to
realize what was in the air, and clung to Blackstock
with a storm of frightened tears.) &ldquo;But
you will understand that I have to catch the
next boat from New York&mdash;and I have a
thirty-mile drive before me now to the nearest
railway station. <i>You</i> know what the roads
are! So I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t think me unreasonable
if I ask you to get my nephew ready
as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Blackstock devoted a few precious moments
to quieting the child&rsquo;s sobs before replying.
He remembered having found out in some way,
from some papers in the drowned Englishman&rsquo;s
pockets or somewhere, that the name of
Woolly Billy&rsquo;s mother, before her marriage,
was not Johnson, but O&rsquo;Neil. Of course that
discrepancy, he realized, might be easily explained,
but his quick suspicions, sharpened by
his devotion to the child, were aroused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not a rich family, by any means,
Mr. Blackstock,&rdquo; continued the stranger, after
a pause. &ldquo;But we have enough to be able to
reward handsomely those who have befriended
us. All <i>possible</i> expense that my nephew may
have been to you, I want to reimburse you for
at once. And I wish also to make you a present
as an expression of my gratitude&mdash;not, I
assure you, as a payment,&rdquo; he added, noticing
that Blackstock&rsquo;s face had hardened ominously.
He took out a thick bill-book, well stuffed with
bank-notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put away your money, Mr. Johnson,&rdquo; said
Blackstock coldly. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t taking any, thank
you, for what I may have done for Woolly
Billy. But what I want to know is, what
authority have you to demand the child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m his uncle, his mother&rsquo;s brother,&rdquo; answered
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
the stranger sharply, drawing himself
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be, an&rsquo; then again, it mayn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
said Blackstock. &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to
hand over the child to a perfect stranger, just
because he comes and says he&rsquo;s the child&rsquo;s
uncle? What proofs have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The visitor glared angrily, but restrained
himself and handed Blackstock his card.</p>
<p>Blackstock read it carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that prove?&rdquo; he demanded
sarcastically. &ldquo;It might not be your card!
An&rsquo; even if you are &lsquo;Mr. Johnson&rsquo; all right,
that&rsquo;s not proving that Mr. Johnson is the
little feller&rsquo;s uncle! I want legal proof, that
would hold in a court of law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You insolent blockhead!&rdquo; exclaimed the
visitor. &ldquo;How dare you interfere between my
nephew and me? If you don&rsquo;t hand him over
at once, I will make you smart for it. Come,
child, get your cap and coat, and come with
me immediately. I have no more time to waste
with this foolery, my man.&rdquo; And he stepped
forward as if to lay hands on Woolly Billy.</p>
<p>Blackstock interposed an inexorable shoulder.
The big dog growled, and stiffened up
the hair on his neck ominously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Blackstock crisply,
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to git yourself into trouble before
you go much further, my lad. You jest
mind your manners. When you bring me
them proofs, I&rsquo;ll talk to you, see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took Woolly Billy&rsquo;s hand, and turned
towards the door.</p>
<p>The stranger&rsquo;s righteous indignation,
strangely enough, seemed to have been allayed
by this speech. He followed eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t</i> be unreasonable, Mr. Blackstock,&rdquo;
he coaxed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you the documents,
from my solicitors, at once. I&rsquo;m sure you
don&rsquo;t want to stand in the dear child&rsquo;s light
this way, and prevent him getting back to his
own people, and the life that is his right, a day
longer than is necessary. Do listen to reason,
now.&rdquo; And he patted his wad of bank-notes
suggestively.</p>
<p>But at this stage, Woolly Billy and the big
dog having already entered the cottage, Blackstock
followed, and calmly shut the door.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll smart for this, you ignorant clod-hopper!&rdquo;
shouted Mr. Heathington Johnson.
He clutched the door-knob. But for all his
rage, prudence came to his rescue. He did
not turn the knob. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation
he ground his heel upon the doorstep,
stalked back to his gig, and drove off furiously.
The three at the window watched his going.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t see <i>him</i> back here again,&rdquo; remarked
the Deputy. &ldquo;<i>He</i> wasn&rsquo;t no uncle o&rsquo;
yours, Woolly Billy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That same evening he wrote to a reliable
firm of lawyers at Exville, telling them all he
knew about Woolly Billy and Woolly Billy&rsquo;s
father, and also all he suspected, and instructed
them to look into the matter fully.</p>
<h3 class="generic">II</h3>
<p>Several weeks went by, and the imposing
stranger, as Blackstock had anticipated, failed
to return with his proofs. Then came a letter
from the lawyers at Exville, saying that they
had something important to communicate, and
Blackstock hurried off to see them, planning to
be away for about a week.</p>
<p>On the day following his departure, to the
delight of all the children and of most of the
rest of the population as well, there arrived at
Brine&rsquo;s Rip Mills a man with a dancing bear.
He was a black-eyed, swarthy, merry fellow,
with a most infectious laugh, and besides his
trained bear he possessed a pedlar&rsquo;s pack containing
all sorts of up-to-date odds and ends,
not by any means to be found in the very
utilitarian miscellany of Zeb Smith&rsquo;s corner
store.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>He talked a rather musical but very broken
lingo that passed for English, flashing a
mouthful of splendid white teeth as he did so.
He appeared to be an Italian, and the men of
Brine&rsquo;s Rip christened him a &ldquo;Dago&rdquo; at once.
There was no resisting his childlike <i>bonhomie</i>,
or the amiable antics of his great brown bear,
which grinned through its muzzle as if dancing
to its master&rsquo;s merry piccolo were its one
delight in life. And the two did a roaring
business from the moment they came strolling
into Brine&rsquo;s Rip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tony&rdquo; was what the laughing vagabond
called himself, and his bear answered to the
name of Beppo. Business being so good, Tony
could afford to be generous, and he was continually
pressing peppermint lozenges upon the
rabble of children who formed a triumphal
procession for him wherever he moved.</p>
<p>When Tony&rsquo;s eyes first fell on Woolly Billy,
standing just outside the crowd, with one arm
over the neck of the big black dog, he was
delighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Com-a here, Bambino, com-a quick!&rdquo; he
cried, holding out some peppermints. Woolly
Billy liked him at once, and adored the bear,
but was too shy, or reserved, to push his way
through the other children. So Tony came to
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
him, leading the bear. Woolly Billy stood his
ground, with a welcoming smile. The big
black dog growled doubtfully, and then lost
his doubts in curious admiration of the bear,
which plainly fascinated him.</p>
<p>Woolly Billy accepted the peppermints
politely, and put one into his mouth without
delay. Then, with an apologetic air, the Italian
laid one finger softly on Woolly Billy&rsquo;s
curls, and drew back at once, as if fearing he
had taken a liberty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim likes the bear, sir, <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i> he?&rdquo; suggested
Woolly Billy, to make conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody he like-a ze bear. Him vaira
good bear,&rdquo; asserted the bear&rsquo;s master, and
laughed again, giving the bear a peppermint.
&ldquo;An&rsquo; you one vaira good bambino. Ze bear,
he like-a you vaira much. See he shak-a you
ze hand&mdash;good frens now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Encouraged by the warmth of his welcome,
the Italian had from the first made a practice
of dropping in at certain houses of the village
just at meal times&mdash;when he was received
always with true backwoods hospitality. On
Woolly Billy&rsquo;s invitation he had come to the
house of Mrs. Amos. The old lady, too rheumatic
to get about much out of doors, was
delighted with such a unique and amusing
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
guest. To all he said&mdash;which, indeed, she
never more than half understood&mdash;she kept
ejaculating, &ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Did ye
ever hear the likes o&rsquo; that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the bear, chained to the gate-post and
devouring her pancakes-and-molasses, thrilled
her with a sense of &ldquo;furrin parts.&rdquo; In fact,
there was no other house at Brine&rsquo;s Rip where
Tony and his bear were made more warmly
welcome than at Mrs. Amos&rsquo;. The only member
of the household who lacked cordiality was
Jim, whose coolness towards Tony, however,
was fully counterbalanced by his interest in
the bear. Towards Tony his attitude was one
of armed neutrality.</p>
<p>On the fourth evening after the arrival of
Tony and Beppo, Jim discovered a most tempting
lump of meat in the corner of Mrs. Amos&rsquo;
garden. Having something of an appetite at
the moment, he was just about to bolt the
morsel. But no sooner had he set his teeth
into it than he conceived a prejudice against
it. He dropped it, and sniffed at it intently.
The smell was quite all right. He turned it
over with his paw and sniffed at the under
side. No, there was nothing the matter with
it. Nevertheless, his appetite had quite vanished.
Well, it would do for another time.
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
He dug a hole and buried the morsel, and then
went back to the house to see what Woolly
Billy and Mrs. Amos were doing.</p>
<p>A little later, just as Mrs. Amos was lighting
the lamps in the kitchen, the rattling of a
chain was heard outside, followed by the whimpering
of Beppo, who objected to being tied
up to the gate-post when he wanted to come in
and beg for pancakes. Woolly Billy ran to
the door and peered forth into the dusk. After
a few moments Tony entered, all his teeth
agleam in his expansive smile.</p>
<p>He had a little bag of bon-bons for Woolly
Billy&mdash;something much more fascinating
than peppermints&mdash;which he doled out to the
child one by one, as a rare treat. And for
himself he wanted a cup of tea, which hospitable
Mrs. Amos was only too eager to brew
for him. Jim, seeing that Woolly Billy was
too interested to need <i>his</i> company, got up and
went out to inspect the bear.</p>
<p>Tony was in gay spirits that evening. In
his broken English, and helping out his meaning
with eloquent gestures, he told of adventures
which made Woolly Billy&rsquo;s eyes as round
as saucers and reduced Mrs. Amos to admiring
speechlessness. He made Mrs. Amos drink
tea with him, pouring it out for her himself
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
while she hobbled about to find him something
to eat. And once in a while, at tantalizing
intervals, he allowed Woolly Billy one more
bon-bon.</p>
<p>There was a chill in the night air, so Tony,
who was always politeness itself, asked leave
to close the door. Mrs. Amos hastened also
to close the window. Or, rather, she tried to
hasten, but made rather a poor attempt, and
sat down heavily in the big arm-chair beside it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My legs is that heavy,&rdquo; she explained,
laughing apologetically. So Tony closed the
window himself, and at the same time drew the
curtains. Then he went on talking.</p>
<p>But apparently his conversation was less
interesting than it had been. There came a
snore from Mrs. Amos&rsquo; big chair. Tony
glanced aside at Woolly Billy, as if expecting
the child to laugh. But Woolly Billy took no
notice of the sound. He was fast asleep, his
fluffy fair head fallen forward upon the red
table-cloth.</p>
<p>Tony looked at the clock on the mantelpiece.
It was not as late as he could have
wished, but he had observed that Brine&rsquo;s Rip
went to bed early. He turned the lamp low,
softly raised the window, and looked out, listening.
There were no lights in the village,
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
and all was silence save for the soft roar of
the Rip. He extinguished the lamp, and
waited a few moments till his eyes got quite
accustomed to the gloom.</p>
<p>At length he picked up the slight form of
Woolly Billy (who was now in a drugged stupor
from which he would not awake for hours),
and slung him over his left shoulder. In his
right hand he grasped his short bear-whip, with
its loaded butt. He stepped noiselessly to the
door, listened a few moments, and then opened
it inch by inch with his left hand, standing
behind it, and grasping the whip so as to be
ready to strike with the butt. He was wondering
where the big black dog was.</p>
<p>The door was about half open, when a black
shape, appearing suddenly, launched itself at
the opening. The loaded butt came crashing
down&mdash;and Jim dropped sprawling across the
threshold.</p>
<p>From the back of the bear Tony now unfastened
a small pack, and strapped it over his
right shoulder. Then he unchained the great
beast noiselessly, and led it off to the water-side,
to a spot where a heavy log canoe was
drawn up upon the beach. He hauled the
canoe down, making much disarrangement in
the gravel, launched it, thrust it far out into
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
the water, and noted it being carried away by
the current. He had no wish to journey by
that route himself, knowing that as soon as
the crime was discovered, which might chance
at any moment, the telephone would give the
alarm all down the river.</p>
<p>Next he undid the bear&rsquo;s chain, and took
off its muzzle, and threw them both into the
water, knowing that when freed from these
badges of servitude the animal would wander
further and more freely. At first the good-natured
creature was unwilling to leave him.
Its master, from policy, had always treated it
kindly, and fed it well, and it was in no hurry
to profit by its freedom.</p>
<p>However, the man ordered it off towards
the woods, enforcing the command by a vigorous
push and a stroke of the whip. Shaking
itself till it realized its freedom, it slouched
away a few paces down stream, then turned
into the woods. The man listened to its careless,
crashing progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll find it easy following <i>that</i> trail,&rdquo;
he muttered with satisfaction.</p>
<p>Assured that he had thus thrown out two
false trails to distract pursuers, the man now
stepped into the water, and walked up stream
for several hundred yards, till he reached the
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
spot which served as a ferry landing. Here,
in the multiplicity of footprints, he knew his
own would be indistinguishable to even the
keenest of backwood eyes. He came ashore,
slipped through the slumbering village, and
plunged into the woods with the assurance of
one to whom their mysteries were an open
book.</p>
<p>He was shaping his course&mdash;by the stars
at present, but by compass when it should
become necessary&mdash;for an inlet on the coast,
where there would be a sturdy fishing-smack
awaiting him and his rich prize. All was
working smoothly&mdash;as most plans were apt to
work under his swift, resourceful hands&mdash;and
his hard lips relaxed in triumphant self-satisfaction.
One of the most accomplished and
relentless of the desperadoes of the Great
North-West, he had peculiarly enjoyed his pose
as the childlike Tony.</p>
<p>For hour after hour he pushed on, till even
his untiring sinews began to protest. About
the edge of dawn Woolly Billy awoke, but, still
stupid with the heavy drugging he had received,
he did not seem to realize what had
happened. He cried a little, asking for Jim,
and for Tug Blackstock, and for Mrs. Amos,
but was pacified by the most trivial excuses.
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
The man gave him some sweet biscuits, but he
refused to eat them, leaving them on the moss
beside him. He hardly protested even when
the man cut off his bright hair, and proceeded
to darken what was left with some queer-smelling
dye.</p>
<p>When the man undressed him and proceeded
to stain his face and his whole body, he apparently
thought he was being got ready for bed,
and to certain terrible threats as to what would
happen if he tried to get away, or to tell any
one anything, he paid no attention whatever.
He went to sleep again in the middle of it all.</p>
<p>Satisfied with his job, the man lay down
beside him, knowing himself secure from pursuit,
and went to sleep himself.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, after lying motionless for several
hours, where he had dropped across the
threshold, Jim at last began to stir. That
crashing blow, after all, had not fallen quite
true. Jim was not dead, by any means. He
staggered to his feet, swayed a few moments,
and then, for all the pain in his head, he was
practically himself again. He went into the
cottage, tried in vain to awaken Mrs. Amos
in her chair, hunted for Woolly Billy in his
bed, and at last, realizing something of what
had happened, rushed forth in a panic of rage
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
and fear and grief, and remorse for a trust
betrayed.</p>
<p>It was a matter of a few minutes to trail the
party down to the waterside. Then he darted
off after the bear. The latter, grubbing delightedly
in a rotten stump, greeted him with
a friendly &ldquo;Woof.&rdquo; A glance and a sniff satisfied
Jim that Woolly Billy was not there, and
his instinct assured him that the bear was
void of offence in the whole matter. He knew
the enemy. He darted back to the waterside,
ran on up stream to the ferry-landing, picked
up the trail of Tony&rsquo;s feet, followed it unerringly
through the confusion of other footprints,
and darted silently into the woods in
pursuit.</p>
<p>At daybreak an early riser, seeing the door
of Mrs. Amos&rsquo; cottage standing open, looked
in and saw the old lady still asleep in her chair.
She was awakened with difficulty, and could
give but a vague account of what had happened.
The whole village turned out. Under
the leadership of Long Jackson, the big mill-hand
who constituted himself Woolly Billy&rsquo;s
special guardian in Blackstock&rsquo;s absence, the
&ldquo;Dago&rdquo; and bear were traced down to the
waterside.</p>
<p>Of course, it was clear to almost every one
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
that the &ldquo;Dago&rdquo;&mdash;who was now due for
lynching when caught&mdash;had carried Woolly
Billy off down river in the vanished canoe.
Instantly the telephones were brought into
service, and half-a-dozen expert canoeists, in
the swiftest canoes to be had, started off in
pursuit. But the more astute of the woods-men&mdash;including
Long Jackson himself&mdash;held
that this river clue was a false one, a ruse
to put them off the track. This group went
after the bear.</p>
<p>In an hour or two they found him. And
very glad to see them he appeared to be. He
was getting hungry, and a bit lonely. So
without waiting for an invitation, with touching
confidence he attached himself to the party,
and accompanied it back to the village. There
Big Andy, who had always had a weakness for
bears, took him home and fed him and shut him
up in the back yard.</p>
<p>In the meantime Jim, travelling at a speed
that the fugitive could not hope to rival, had
come soon after daybreak to the spot where the
man and Woolly Billy lay asleep.</p>
<p>He arrived as soundlessly as a shadow. At
sight of his enemy&mdash;for he knew well who
had carried off the child, and who had dealt
that almost fatal blow&mdash;his long white fangs
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
bared in a silent snarl of hate. But he had
learnt, well learnt, that this man was a dangerous
antagonist. He crouched, stiffened as
if to stone, and surveyed the situation.</p>
<p>His sensitive nose prevented him from being
quite deceived by the transformation in Woolly
Billy&rsquo;s appearance. He was puzzled by it, but
he had no doubt as to the child&rsquo;s identity. Having
satisfied himself that the little fellow was
asleep, and therefore presumably safe for the
moment, he turned his attention to his enemy.</p>
<p>The man was sleeping almost on his back,
one arm thrown above his head, his chin up,
his brown, sinewy throat exposed. That bare
throat riveted Jim&rsquo;s vengeful gaze. He knew
well that the man, though asleep and at an
utter disadvantage, was the most dangerous
adversary he could possibly tackle.</p>
<p>Step by step, so lightly, so smoothly, that not
a twig crackled under his feet, he crept up, his
muzzle outstretched, his fangs gleaming, the
hair rising along his back. When he was
within a couple of paces of his goal, the sleeper
stirred slightly, as if about to wake up, or
growing conscious of danger. Instantly Jim
sprang, and sank his fangs deep, deep, into
his enemy&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>With a shriek the sleeper awoke, flinging
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
wide his arms and legs convulsively. But the
shriek was strangled at its birth, as Jim&rsquo;s
implacable teeth crunched closer. The great
dog shook his victim as a terrier shakes a rat.
There was a choked gurgle, and the threshing
arms and legs lay still.</p>
<p>Jim continued his savage shaking till satisfied
his foe was quite dead. Then he let go,
and turned his attention to Woolly Billy.</p>
<p>The child was sitting up, staring at him with
round eyes of question and bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I, Jim?&rdquo; he demanded. Then
he gazed at the transformation in himself&mdash;his
clothes and his stained hands. He saw his
old clothes tossed aside, his curls lying near
them in a bright, fluffy heap. He felt his
cropped head. And then his brain began to
clear. He had a dim memory of the man cutting
his hair and changing his clothes.</p>
<p>Upon his first glimpse of the man, lying there
dead and covered with blood, he felt a sharp
pang of sorrow. He had liked Tony. But
the pang passed, as he began to understand.
If <i>Jim</i> had killed Tony, Tony must have been
bad. It was evident that Tony had carried
him off, and that Jim had come to save him.
Jim was licking his face now, rapturously, and
evidently coaxing him to get up and come away.</p>
<p>He flung his arms around Jim&rsquo;s neck. Then
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
he saw the biscuits. He divided them evenly
between himself and Jim, and ate his portion
with good appetite. Jim would not touch his
share, so Woolly Billy tucked them into his
pocket. Then he got up and followed where
Jim was trying to lead him, keeping his face
averted from the terrible, bleeding thing
sprawled there upon the moss. And Jim led
him safely home.</p>
<p>When Tug Blackstock, two days later, returned
from his visit to Exville, he brought
news which explained why a certain gang of
criminals had planned to get possession of
Woolly Billy. The child had fallen heir to an
immense property in England, and an ancient
title, and he was to have been held for ransom.
From that moment Blackstock never let him
out of his sight, until, with a heavy heart, he
handed him over to his own people.</p>
<p>Thereafter, as he sat brooding on a log beside
the noisy river, with Jim stretched at his
feet, Tug Blackstock felt that Brine&rsquo;s Rip, for
the lack of a childish voice and a head of flaxen
curls, had lost all savour for him. And his
thoughts turned more and more towards the
arguments of a grey-eyed girl, who had urged
him to seek a wider sphere for his energies
than the confines of Nipsiwaska County could
afford.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<h2 id="c8">THE EAGLE</h2>
<p>He sat upon the very topmost perch under
the open-work dome of his spacious
and lofty cage. This perch was one of three
or four lopped limbs jutting from a dead tree-trunk
erected in the centre of the cage&mdash;a
perch far other than that great branch of
thunder-blasted pine, out-thrust from the seaward-facing
cliff, whereon he had been wont
to sit in his own land across the ocean.</p>
<p>He sat with his snowy, gleaming, flat-crowned
head drawn back between the dark
shoulders of his slightly uplifted wings. His
black and yellow eyes, unwinking, bright and
hard like glass, stared out from under his
overhanging brows with a kind of darting and
defiant inquiry quite unlike their customary
expression of tameless despair. That dull
world outside the bars of his cage, that hated,
gaping, inquisitive world which he had ever
tried to ignore by staring at the sun or gazing
into the deeps of sky overhead, how it had
changed since yesterday! The curious crowds,
the gabbling voices were gone. Even the high
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
buildings of red brick or whitish-grey stone,
beyond the iron palings of the park, were
going, toppling down with a slow, dizzy lurch,
or leaping suddenly into the air with a roar
and a huge belch of brown and orange smoke
and scarlet flame. Here and there he saw men
running wildly. Here and there he saw other
men lying quite still&mdash;sprawling, inert shapes
on the close-cropped grass, or the white
asphalted walks, or the tossed pavement of the
street. He knew that these inert, sprawling
shapes were men, and that the men were dead;
and the sight filled his exile heart with triumph.
Men were his enemies, his gaolers, his opponents,
and now at last&mdash;he knew not how&mdash;he
was tasting vengeance. The once smooth
green turf around his cage was becoming
pitted with strange yellow-brown holes. These
holes, he had noticed, always appeared after
a burst of terrific noise, and livid flame, and
coloured smoke, followed by a shower of clods
and pebbles, and hard fragments which sometimes
flew right through his cage with a vicious
hum. There was a deadly force in these humming
fragments. He knew it, for his partner
in captivity, a golden eagle of the Alps, had
been hit by one of them, and now lay dead on
the littered floor below him, a mere heap of
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
bloody feathers. Certain of the iron bars of
the cage, too, had been struck and cut through,
as neatly as his own hooked beak would sever
the paw of a rabbit.</p>
<p>The air was full of tremendous crashing,
buffeting sounds and sudden fierce gusts, which
forced him to tighten the iron grip of his talons
upon the perch. In the centre of the little park
pond, some fifty feet from his cage, clustered
a panic-stricken knot of eight or ten fancy
ducks and two pairs of red-billed coot, all that
remained of the flock of water-birds which had
formerly screamed and gabbled over the pool.
This little cluster was in a state of perpetual
ferment, those on the outside struggling to get
into the centre, those on the inside striving to
keep their places. From time to time one or
two on the outer ring would dive under and
force their way up in the middle of the press,
where they imagined themselves more secure.
But presently they would find themselves on
the outside again, whereupon, in frantic haste,
they would repeat the man&oelig;uvre. The piercing
glance of the eagle took in and dismissed
this futile panic with immeasurable scorn.
With like scorn, too, he noted the three gaunt
cranes which had been wont to stalk so arrogantly
among the lesser fowl and drive them
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
from their meals. These once domineering
birds were now standing huddled, their
drooped heads close together, beneath a dense
laurel thicket just behind the cage, their long
legs quaking at every explosion.</p>
<p>Amid all this destroying tumult and flying
death the eagle had no fear. He was merely
excited by it. If a fragment of shell sang past
his head, he never flinched, his level stare never
even filmed or wavered. The roar and crash,
indeed, and the monstrous bufferings of tormented
air, seemed to assuage the long ache of
his home-sickness. They reminded him of the
hurricane racing past his ancient pine, of the
giant waves shattering themselves with thunderous
jar upon the cliff below. From time to
time, as if his nerves were straining with irresistible
exultation, he would lift himself to his
full height, half spread his wings, stretch forward
his gleaming white neck, and give utterance
to a short, strident, yelping cry. Then he
would settle back upon his perch again, and
resume his fierce contemplation of the ruin that
was falling on the city.</p>
<p>Suddenly an eleven-inch shell dropped
straight in the centre of the pool and exploded
on the concrete bottom which underlay the
mud. Half the pool went up in the colossal
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
eruption of blown flame and steam and smoke.
Even here on his perch the eagle found himself
spattered and drenched. When the
shrunken surface of the pool had closed again
over the awful vortex, and the smoke had
drifted off to join itself to the dark cloud which
hung over the city, the little flock of ducks and
coot was nowhere to be seen. It simply was
not. But a bleeding fragment of flesh, with
some purple-and-chestnut feathers clinging to
it, lay upon the bottom of the cage. This
morsel caught the eagle&rsquo;s eye. He had been
forgotten for the past two days&mdash;the old
one-legged keeper of the cages having vanished&mdash;and
he was ravenous with hunger.
He hopped down briskly to the floor, grabbed
the morsel, and gulped it. Then he looked
around hopefully for more. There were no
more such opportune tit-bits within the cage,
but just outside he saw the half of a big carp,
which had been torn in twain by a caprice of
the explosion and tossed up here upon the
grass. This was just such a morsel as he was
craving. He thrust one great talon out between
the bars and clutched at the prize. But
it was beyond his reach. Disappointed, he
tried the other claw, balancing himself on one
leg with widespread wings. Stretch and
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
struggle as he would, it was all in vain. The
fish lay too far off. Then he tried reaching
through the bars with his head. He elongated
his neck till he almost thought he was a heron,
and till his great beak was snapping hungrily
within an inch or two of the prize. But not a
hair&rsquo;s-breadth closer could he get. At last,
in a cold fury, he gave it up, and drew back,
and shook himself to rearrange the much
dishevelled feathers of his neck.</p>
<p>Just at this moment, while he was still on
the floor of the cage, a high-velocity shell came
by. With its flat trajectory it passed just
overhead, swept the dome of the cage clean out
of existence, and whizzed onwards to explode,
with a curious grunting crash, some hundreds
of yards beyond. The eagle looked up and
gazed for some seconds before realizing that
his prison was no longer a prison. The path
was clear above him to the free spaces of the
air. But he was in no unseemly haste. His
eye measured accurately the width of the exit,
and saw that it was awkwardly narrow for his
great spread of wing. He could not essay it
directly from the ground, his quarters being
too straitened for free flight. Hopping upwards
from limb to limb of the roosting-tree,
he regained the topmost perch, and found that,
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
though split by a stray splinter of the cage, it
was still able to bear his weight. From this
point he sprang straight upwards, with one
beat of his wings. But the wing-tips struck
violently against each side of the opening, and
he was thrown back with such force that only
by a furious flopping and struggle could he
regain his footing on the perch.</p>
<p>After this unexpected rebuff he sat quiet for
perhaps half a minute, staring fixedly at the
exit. He was not going to fail again through
misjudgment. The straight top of the roosting-tree
extended for about three feet above
his perch, but this extension being of no use
to him, he had never paid any heed to it hitherto.
Now, however, he marked it with new
interest. It was close below the hole in the
roof. He flopped up to it, balanced himself
for a second, and once more sprang for the
opening, but this time with a short, convulsive
beat of wings only half spread. The leap carried
him almost through, but not far enough
for him to get another stroke of his wings.
Clutching out wildly with stretched talons, he
succeeded in catching the end of a broken bar.
Desperately he clung to it, resisting the natural
impulse to help himself by flapping his wings.
Reaching out with his beak, he gripped another
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
bar, and so steadied himself till he could gain
a foothold with both talons. Then slowly, like
a dog getting over a wall, he dragged himself
forth, and stood at last free on the outer side
of the bars which had been so long his
prison.</p>
<p>But the first thing he thought of was not
freedom. It was fish. For perhaps a dozen
seconds he gazed about him majestically, and
scanned with calm the toppling and crashing
world. Then spreading his splendid wings to
their fullest extent, with no longer any fear
of them striking against iron bars, he dropped
down to the grass beside the cage and clutched
the body of the slain carp. He was no more
than just in time, for a second later a pair of
mink, released from their captivity in perhaps
the same way as he had been, came gliding furtively
around the base of the cage, intent upon
the same booty. He turned his head over his
shoulder and gave them one look, then fell to
tearing and gulping his meal as unconcernedly
as if the two savage little beasts had been field
mice. The mink stopped short, flashed white
fangs at him in a soundless snarl of hate, and
whipped about to forage in some more auspicious
direction.</p>
<p>When the eagle had finished his meal&mdash;which
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
took him, indeed, scarcely more time
than takes to tell of it&mdash;he wiped his great
beak meticulously on the turf. While he was
doing so, a shell burst so near him that he was
half smothered in dry earth. Indignantly he
shook himself, hopped a pace or two aside,
ruffled up his feathers, and proceeded to make
his toilet as scrupulously as if no shells or
sudden death were within a thousand miles of
him.</p>
<p>The toilet completed to his satisfaction, he
took a little flapping run and rose into the air.
He flew straight for the highest point within
his view, which chanced to be the slender, soaring
spire of a church somewhere about the
centre of the city. As he mounted on a long
slant, he came into the level where most of
the shells were travelling, for their objective
was not the little park with its &ldquo;Zoo,&rdquo; but a
line of fortifications some distance beyond.
Above, below, around him streamed the terrible
projectiles, whinnying or whistling,
shrieking or roaring, each according to its
calibre and its type. It seemed a miracle that
he should come through that zone unscathed;
but his vision was so powerful and all-embracing,
his judgment of speed and distance so
instantaneous and unerring, that he was able
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
to avoid, without apparent effort, all but the
smallest and least visible shells, and these latter,
by the favour of Fate, did not come his
way. He was more annoyed, indeed, by certain
volleys of <i>d&eacute;bris</i> which occasionally
spouted up at him with a disagreeable noise,
and by the evil-smelling smoke clouds, which
came volleying about him without any reason
that he could discern. He flapped up to a
higher level to escape these annoyances, and
so found himself above the track of the shells.
Then he made for the church spire, and perched
himself upon the tip of the great weather-vane.
It was exactly what he wanted&mdash;a lofty observation
post from which to view the country
round about before deciding in which direction
he would journey.</p>
<p>From this high post he noticed that, while
he was well above one zone of shells, there
was still another zone of them screaming far
overhead. These projectiles of the upper
strata of air were travelling in the opposite
direction. He marked that they came from
a crowded line of smoke-bursts and blinding
flashes just beyond the boundary of the city.
He decided that, upon resuming his journey,
he would fly at the present level, and so avoid
traversing again either of the zones of death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>Much to his disappointment, he found that
his present observation post did not give him
as wide a view as he had hoped for. The
city of his captivity, he now saw, was set upon
the loop of a silver stream in the centre of a
saucer-like valley. In every direction his view
was limited by low, encircling hills. Along
one sector of this circuit&mdash;that from which
the shells of the lower stratum seemed to him
to be issuing&mdash;the hill-rim and the slopes
below it were fringed with vomiting smoke-clouds
and biting spurts of fire. This did not,
however, influence in the least his choice of
the direction in which to journey. Instinct,
little by little, as he sat there on the slowly
veering vane, was deciding that point for him.
His gaze was fixing itself more and more towards
the north, or, rather, the north-west;
for something seemed to whisper in his heart
that there was where he would find the wild
solitudes which he longed for. The rugged
and mist-wreathed peaks of Scotland or North
Wales, though he knew them not, were calling
to him in his new-found freedom.</p>
<p>The call, however, was not yet strong enough
to be determining, so, having well fed and
being beyond measure content with his liberty,
he lingered on his skyey perch and watched
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
the crash of the opposing bombardments. The
quarter of the town immediately beneath him
had so far suffered little from the shells, and
the church showed no signs of damage except
for one gaping hole in the roof. But along
the line of the fortifications there seemed to be
but one gigantic boiling of smoke and flames,
with continual spouting fountains of <i>d&eacute;bris</i>.
This inexplicable turmoil held his interest for
a few moments. Then, while he was wondering
what it all meant, an eleven-inch shell
struck the church spire squarely about thirty
feet below him.</p>
<p>The explosion almost stunned him. The tip
of the spire&mdash;with the weather-cock, and the
eagle still clinging to it&mdash;went rocketing
straight up into the air amid a stifling cloud of
black smoke, while the rest of the structure,
down to a dozen feet below the point of impact,
was blown to the four winds. Half stunned
though he was, the amazed bird kept his wits
about him, and clutched firmly to his flying
perch till it reached the end of its flight and
turned to fall. Then he spread his wings wide
and let go. The erratic mass of wood and
metal dropped away, and left him floating,
half-blinded, in the heart of the smoke-cloud.
A couple of violent wing-beats, however, carried
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
him clear of the cloud; and at once he
shaped his course upwards, as steeply as he
could mount, smitten with a sudden desire for
the calm and the solitude which were associated
in his memory with the uppermost deeps
of air.</p>
<p>The fire from the city batteries had just now
slackened for a little, and the great bird&rsquo;s
progress carried him through the higher shell
zone without mishap. In a minute or two he
was far above those strange flocks which flew
so straight and swift, and made such incomprehensible
noises in their flight. Presently, too,
he was above the smoke, the very last wisps
of it having thinned off into the clear, dry air.
He now began to find that he had come once
more into his own peculiar realm, the realm of
the upper sky, so high that, as he thought, no
other living creature could approach him. He
arrested his ascent, and began to circle slowly
on still wings, surveying the earth.</p>
<p>But now he received, for the first time, a
shock. Hitherto the most astounding happenings
had failed to startle him, but now a pang
of something very like fear shot through his
stout heart. A little to southward of the city
he saw a vast pale-yellow elongated form rising
swiftly, without any visible effort, straight
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
into the sky. Had he ever seen a sausage, he
would have thought that this yellow monster
was shaped like one. Certain fine cords descended
from it, reaching all the way to the
earth, and below its middle hung a basket, with
a man in it. It rose to a height some hundreds
of feet beyond the level on which the eagle had
been feeling himself supreme. Then it came
to rest, and hung there, swaying slowly in the
mild wind.</p>
<p>His apprehension speedily giving way to
injured pride, the eagle flew upwards, in short,
steep spirals, as fast as his wings could drive
him. Not till he could once more look down
upon the fat back of the glistening yellow monster
did he regain his mood of unruffled calm.
But he regained it only to have it stripped from
him, a minute later, with tenfold lack of ceremony.
For far above him&mdash;so high that even
his undaunted wings would never venture
thither&mdash;he heard a fierce and terrible humming
sound. He saw something like a colossal
bird&mdash;or rather, it was more suggestive of a
dragon-fly than a bird&mdash;speeding towards him
with never a single beat of its vast, pale wings.
Its speed was appalling. The eagle was afraid,
but not with any foolish panic. He knew that
even as a sparrow would be to him, so would
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
he be to this unheard-of sovereign of the skies.
Therefore it was possible the sovereign of the
skies would ignore him and seek a more worthy
opponent. Yes, it was heading towards the
giant sausage. And the sausage, plainly, had
no stomach for the encounter. It seemed to
shrink suddenly; and with sickening lurches it
began to descend, as if strong hands were tugging
upon the cords which anchored it to earth.
The eagle winged off modestly to one side, but
not far enough to miss anything of the stupendous
encounter which he felt was coming.
Here, at last, were events of a strangeness and
a terror to move even his cool spirit out of its
indifference.</p>
<p>Now the giant insect was near enough for
the eagle to mark that it had eyes on the undersides
of its wings&mdash;immense, round, coloured
eyes of red and white and blue. Its shattering
hum shook the eagle&rsquo;s nerves, steady and seasoned
though they were. Slanting slightly
downwards, it darted straight toward the sausage,
which was now wallowing fatly in its
convulsive efforts to descend. At the same
time the eagle caught sight of another of the
giant birds, or insects, somewhat different in
shape and colour from the first, darting up
from the opposite direction. Was it, too, he
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
wondered, coming to attack the terrified
sausage, or to defend it?</p>
<p>Before he could find an answer to this exciting
question, the first monster had arrived
directly above the sausage and was circling
over it at some height, glaring down upon it
with those great staring eyes of its wings.
Something struck the sausage fairly in the
back. Instantly, with a tremendous windy
roar, the sausage vanished in a sheet of flame.
The monster far above it rocked and plunged
in the uprush of tormented air, the waves of
which reached even to where the eagle hung
poised, and forced him to flap violently in order
to keep his balance against them.</p>
<p>A few moments later the second monster
arrived. The eagle saw at once that the two
were enemies. The first dived headlong at the
second, spitting fire, with a loud and dreadful
rap-rap-rapping noise, from its strange blunt
muzzle. The two circled around each other,
and over and under each other, at a speed
which made even the eagle dizzy with amazement;
and he saw that it was something more
deadly than fire which spurted from their blunt
snouts; for every now and then small things,
which travelled too fast for him to see, twanged
past him with a vicious note which he knew for
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
the voice of death. He edged discreetly farther
away. Evidently this battle of the giants
was dangerous to spectators. His curiosity
was beginning to get sated. He was on the
point of leaving the danger area altogether,
when the dreadful duel came suddenly to an
end. He saw the second monster plunge
drunkenly, in wild, ungoverned lurches, and
then drop head first, down, down, down,
straight as a stone, till it crashed into the earth
and instantly burst into flame. He saw the
great, still eyes of the victor staring down
inscrutably upon the wreck of its foe. Then
he saw it whirl sharply&mdash;tilting its rigid wings
at so steep an angle that it almost seemed about
to overturn&mdash;and dart away again in the
direction from which it had come. He saw
the reason for this swift departure. A flock
of six more monsters, of the breed of the one
just slain, came sweeping up from the south
to take vengeance for their comrade&rsquo;s defeat.</p>
<p>The eagle had no mind to await them. He
had had enough of wonders, and the call in
his heart had suddenly grown clear and intelligible.
Mounting still upward till he felt the
air growing thin beneath his wing-beats, he
headed northwards as fast as he could fly.
He had no more interest now in the amazing
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
panorama which unrolled beneath him, in the
thundering and screaming flights of shell which
sped past in the lower strata of the air. He
was intent only upon gaining the wild solitudes
of which he dreamed. He marked others of
the monsters which he so dreaded, journeying
sometimes alone, sometimes in flocks, but
always with the same implacable directness of
flight, always with that angry and menacing
hum which, of all the sounds he had ever heard,
alone had power to shake his bold heart. He
noticed that sometimes the sky all about these
monsters would be filled with sudden bursts
of fleecy cloud, looking soft as wool; and once
he saw one of these apparently harmless clouds
burst full on the nose of one of the monsters,
which instantly flew apart and went hurtling
down to earth in revolving fragments. But
he was no longer curious. He gave them all
as wide a berth as possible, and sped on, without
delaying to note their triumphs or their
defeats.</p>
<p>At last the earth grew green again below
him. The monsters, the smoke, the shells, the
flames, the thunders, were gradually left behind,
and far ahead at last he saw the sea,
flashing gold and sapphire beneath the summer
sun. Soon&mdash;for he flew swiftly&mdash;it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
almost beneath him. His heart exulted at the
sight. Then across that stretch of gleaming
tide he saw a dim line of cliffs&mdash;white cliffs,
such cliffs as he desired.</p>
<p>But at this point, when he was so near his
goal, that Fate which had always loved to
juggle with him decided to show him a new
one of her tricks. Two more monsters appeared,
diving steeply from the blue above him.
One was pursuing the other. Quite near him
the pursuer overtook its quarry, and the two
spat fire at each other with that strident rap-rap-rapping
sound which he so disliked. He
swerved as wide as possible from the path of
their terrible combat, and paid no heed to its
outcome. But, as he fled, something struck
him near the tip of his left wing.</p>
<p>The shock went through him like a needle of
ice or fire, and he dropped, leaving a little
cloud of feathers in the air above to settle
slowly after him. He turned once completely
over as he fell. But presently, with terrific
effort, he succeeded in regaining a partial balance.
He could no longer fully support himself,
still less continue his direct flight; but he
managed to keep on an even keel and to delay
his fall. He knew that to drop into the sea
below him was certain death. But he had
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
marked that the sea was dotted with peculiar-looking
ships&mdash;long, narrow, dark ships&mdash;which
travelled furiously, vomiting black
smoke and carrying a white mass of foam in
their teeth. Supporting himself, with the last
ounce of his strength, till one of these rushing
ships was just about to pass below him, he let
himself drop, and landed sprawling on the
deck.</p>
<p>Half stunned though he was, he recovered
himself almost instantly, clawed up to his feet,
steadied himself with one outstretched wing
against the pitching of the deck, and defied,
with hard, undaunted eye and threatening beak,
a tall figure in blue, white-capped and gold-braided,
which stood smiling down upon him.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>&ldquo;By Jove,&rdquo; exclaimed Sub-Lieutenant James
Smith, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s luck: Uncle Sam&rsquo;s own chicken,
which he&rsquo;s sent us as a mascot till his ships can
get over and take a hand in the game with us:
Delighted to see you, old bird: You&rsquo;ve come
to the right spot, you have, and we&rsquo;ll do the
best we can to make you comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<h2 id="c9">THE MULE</h2>
<p>The mule lines at Aveluy were restless
and unsteady under the tormented
dark. All day long a six-inch high-velocity
gun, firing at irregular intervals from somewhere
on the low ridge beyond the Ancre, had
been feeling for them. Those terrible swift
shells, which travel so fast, on their flat trajectory,
that their bedlam shriek of warning
and the rending crash of their explosion seem
to come in the same breathless instant, had
tested the nerves of man and beast sufficiently
during the daylight; but now, in the shifting
obscurity of a young moon harrowed by driving
cloud-rack, their effect was yet more daunting.
So far they had been doing little damage,
having been occupied, for the most part, in
blowing new craters in the old lines, a couple
of hundred yards further east, which had been
vacated only two days before on account of
their deep-trodden and intolerable mud. All
day our &rsquo;planes, patrolling the sky over Tara
Hill and the lines of Regina, had kept the
Boche&rsquo;s airmen at such a distance that they
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
could not observe and register for their batteries;
and this terrible gun was, therefore,
firing blind. But there came a time, during
the long night, when it seemed to reach the
conclusion that its target must be pretty well
obliterated. Squatting in its veiled lair behind
the heights of Ancre, it lifted its raking muzzle,
ever so slightly, and put another two hundred
yards on to its range.</p>
<p>The next shell screamed down straight upon
the lines. The crash tore earth and air. A
massive column of black smoke vomited upwards,
pierced with straight flame and streaked
with flying fragments of mules and ropes and
tether-pegs. Deadly splinters of shell hissed
forth from it on all sides. The top of the column
spread outwards; the base thinned and
lifted; a raw and ghastly crater, like some Dantesque
dream of the mouth of Hell, came into
view; and there followed a faint, hideous sound
of nameless things pattering down upon the
mud.</p>
<p>Near the edge of the crater stood a big, raw-boned
black mule. His team mate and the
three other mules tethered nearest to him had
vanished. Several others lay about on either
side of him, dead or screaming in their death
agonies. But he was untouched. At the
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
appalling shock he had sprung back upon his
haunches, snorting madly; but the tethering-rope
had held, and he had almost thrown himself.
Then, after the fashion of his kind, he
had lashed out wildly with his iron-shod heels.
But he was tough of nerve and stout of heart
far beyond the fashion of his kind, and almost
at once he pulled himself together and stood
trembling, straining on the halter, his long ears
laid back upon his head. Then his eyes, rolling
white, with a green gleam of horror at the
centre, took note of the familiar form of his
driver, standing by his head and feeling himself
curiously, as if puzzled at being still alive.</p>
<p>This sight reassured the black mule amazingly.
His expressive ears wagged forward
again, and he thrust his frothing muzzle hard
against the man&rsquo;s shoulder, as if to ask him
what it all meant. The man flung an arm over
the beast&rsquo;s quivering neck and leaned himself
against him for a moment or two, dazed from
the tremendous shock which had lifted him
from his feet and slammed him down viciously
upon the ground. He coughed once or twice,
and tried to wipe the reek of the explosion from
his eyes. Then, coming fully to himself, he
hurriedly untethered his charge, patted him
reassuringly on the nose, loosed the next mule
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
behind him on the lines, and led the two away
in haste toward safer quarters. As he did so,
another shell came in, some fifty yards to the
left, and the lines became a bedlam of kicking
and snorting beasts, with their drivers, cursing
and coaxing, according to their several methods,
clawing at the ropes and hurrying to get
their charges away to safety.</p>
<p>At any other time the big black mule&mdash;an
unregenerate product of the Argentine, with a
temper which took delight in giving trouble to
all in authority over him&mdash;might have baulked
energetically as a protest against being moved
from his place at this irregular hour. But he
was endowed with a perception of his own interests,
which came rather from the humbler
than the more aristocratic side of his ancestry.
He was no victim of that childish panic which
is so liable, in a moment of desperation, to pervert
the high-strung intelligence of the horse.
He felt that the man knew just what to do in
this dreadful and demoralizing situation. So
he obeyed and followed like a lamb; and in that
moment he conceived an affection for his driver
which made him nothing less than a changed
mule. His amazing docility had its effect upon
the second mule, and the driver got them both
away without any difficulty. When all the
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
rest of the survivors had been successfully
shifted to new ground, far off to the right, the
terrible gun continued for another hour to blow
craters up and down the deserted lines. Then
it lengthened its range once more, and spent
the rest of the night shattering to powder the
ruins of an already ruined and quite deserted
street, under the impression that it was smashing
up some of our crowded billets. A little
before daylight, however, a shell from one of
our forward batteries, up behind Regina
Trench, found its way into the lair where the
monster squatted, and rest descended upon
Aveluy in the bleak autumnal dawn.</p>
<p>This was in the rain-scourged autumn of
1916, when the unspeakable desolation of the
Somme battlefield was a sea of mud. The
ruins of the villages&mdash;Ovillers, La Boisselle,
Pozi&egrave;res, Courcelette, Martinpuich, and all the
others which had once made fair with flowers
and orchards this rolling plateau of Picardy&mdash;had
been pounded flat by the inexorable guns,
and were now mere islands of firmer ground
in the shell-pitted wastes of red mire. Men
went encased in mud from boots to shrapnel
helmet. And it was a special mud of exasperating
tenacity, a cement of beaten chalk and
clay. The few spidery tram-lines ran precariously
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
along the edges of the shell-holes, out
over the naked, fire-swept undulations beyond
Mouquet Farm and Courcelette, where they
were continually being knocked to pieces by the
&ldquo;whizz-bangs,&rdquo; and tirelessly rebuilt by our
dauntless pioneers and railway troops. Scattered
all about this dreadful naked waste behind
our front trenches lurked our forward
batteries, their shallow gun-pits cunningly
camouflaged behind every little swell of tumbled
mud.</p>
<p>This foul mud, hiding in the deep slime of
its shell-holes every kind of trap and putrid
horror, was the appropriate ally of the Germans.
Stinkingly and tenaciously and treacherously,
as befitted, it opposed the feeding of
the guns. Two by two or four by four, according
to their size, the shells for the guns had to
be carried up from the forward dumps in little
wicker panniers slung across the backs of
horses and mules. It was a slow process, precarious
and costly, but it beat the mud, and
the insatiable guns were fed.</p>
<p>After the night when the mule-lines at
Aveluy were shelled, the big black mule and his
driver were put on this job of carrying up
shells to the forward batteries. The driver,
a gaunt, green-eyed, ginger-haired teamster
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
from the lumber camps of Northern New
Brunswick, received the order with a crooked
grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say your prayers now, Sonny,&rdquo; he muttered
in the mule&rsquo;s big, waving ear, which came
to &ldquo;attention&rdquo; promptly to receive his communication.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be wishing you was back
in them old lines at Aveluy afore we&rsquo;re through
with this job. Fritzy over yonder ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;
to like you an&rsquo; me one little bit when he gits
on to what we&rsquo;re up to. It ain&rsquo;t like haulin&rsquo;
fodder, I tell you that. But I guess we&rsquo;ve got
the nerve all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of rolling the whites of his eyes at
him, in surly protest against this familiarity,
the black mule responded by nibbling gently at
the sleeve of his muddy tunic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geezely Christmas,&rdquo; murmured the driver,
astonished at this evidence of goodwill, &ldquo;but
it&rsquo;s queer, now, how a taste o&rsquo; shell-fire&rsquo;ll sometimes
work a change o&rsquo; heart, even in an Argentino
mule. I only hope it&rsquo;ll last, Sonny. If
it does, we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to git along fine, you an&rsquo;
me.&rdquo; And the next time he visited the canteen
he brought back a biscuit or two and a slab of
sweet chocolate, to confirm the capricious beast
in its mended manners.</p>
<p>Early that same afternoon the black mule
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
found himself in new surroundings. He was
at the big ammunition dump which lay concealed
in an obscure hollow near the ruins of
Courcelette. He looked with suspicion on the
wicker panniers which were slung across his
sturdy back. Saddles he knew, and harness he
knew, but this was a contraption which roused
misgivings in his conservative soul. When the
shells were slipped into the panniers, and he
felt the sudden weight, so out of all proportion
to the size of the burden, he laid back his long
ears with a grunt, and gathered his muscles
for a protesting kick. But his driver, standing
at his head, stroked his muzzle soothingly
and murmured: &ldquo;There, there, steady, Son!
Keep your hair on! It ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to bite you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus adjured, he composed himself with an
effort, and the lashing kick was not delivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a persuasive cuss you must be,
Jimmy Wright!&rdquo; said the man who was handling
the shells. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t trust you round
with my best girl, if you can get a bucking mule
locoed that way with your soft sawder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t me,&rdquo; replied the New Brunswicker.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s shell-shock, I guess, kind of helped along
with chocolate an&rsquo; biscuits. He got a bit of a
shaking up when they shelled the lines at
Aveluy night afore last, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s been a lamb
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
ever since. Seems to think <i>I</i> saved his hide for
him. He was the very devil to handle afore
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some way from the dump the journey
was uneventful. The path to the guns led
along a sunken road, completely hidden from
the enemy&rsquo;s observation posts. The dull, persistent
rain had ceased for a little, and the
broad patches of blue overhead were dotted
with our droning aeroplanes, which every now
and then would dive into a low-drifting rack of
grey cloud to shake off the shrapnel of the German
&ldquo;Archies.&rdquo; Of German &rsquo;planes none
were to be seen, for they had all sped home to
their hangars when our fighting squadrons rose
to the encounter. The earth rocked to the explosions
of our 9.2 howitzers ranged about
Pozi&egrave;res and Martinpuich, and the air clamoured
under the passage of their giant shells
as they went roaring over toward the German
lines. Now and again a vicious whining sound
would swell suddenly to a nerve-racking shriek,
and an enemy shell would land with a massive
<i>cr-r-ump</i>, and a furious blast of smoke and mud
would belch upwards to one side or other of
the sunken road. But none of these unwelcome
visitors came into the road itself, and
neither the black mule nor Jimmy Wright paid
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
them any more attention than the merest roll
of an eye to mark their billet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Change o&rsquo; heart hain&rsquo;t spoiled old Sonny&rsquo;s
nerve, anyhow,&rdquo; thought the driver to himself,
with deep approval.</p>
<p>A little further on and the trail up to &ldquo;X&rsquo;s
Group,&rdquo; quitting the shelter of the sunken road,
led out across the red desolation, in the very
eye, as it seemed to the New Brunswicker, of
the enemy&rsquo;s positions. It was a narrow, undulating
track, slippery as oil, yet tenacious as
glue, corkscrewing its laborious way between
the old slime-filled shell-pits. From the surface
of one of these wells of foul-coloured ooze
the legs of a dead horse stuck up stiffly into the
air, like four posts on which to lay a foot-bridge.
A few yards beyond, the track was
cut by a fresh shell-hole, too new to have collected
any water. Its raw sides were streaked
red and white and black, and just at its rim
lay the mangled fragments of something that
might recently have been a mule. The long
ears of Wright&rsquo;s mule waved backwards and
forwards at the sight, and he snorted apprehensively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This don&rsquo;t appear to be a health resort for
us, Sonny,&rdquo; commented the New Brunswicker,
&ldquo;so we won&rsquo;t linger, if it&rsquo;s all the same to you.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
And he led the way around the other side of the
new shell-hole, the big mule crowding close behind
with quivering muzzle at his shoulder.</p>
<p>However urgent Wright&rsquo;s desire for speed,
speed was ridiculously impossible. The obstinate
pro-German mud was not lightly to be
overcome. Even on the firmer ridges it clung
far above the fetlocks of the black mule, and
struggled to suck off Wright&rsquo;s hobnailed boots
at every labouring step. Though a marrow-piercing
north-easter swept the waste, both
man and mule were lathered in sweat. Half
their energy had to be expended in recovering
themselves from continual slithering slides
which threatened to land them in the engulfing
horrors of the shell-holes. For all that he had
so little breath to spare, Jimmy Wright kept
muttering through his teeth strange expletives
and objurgations from the vocabulary of the
lumber camps, eloquent but unprintable, to
which the black mule lent ear admiringly. He
seemed to feel that his driver&rsquo;s remarks, though
he could not understand them, were doubtless
such as would command his fullest accord.
For his own part he had no means of expressing
such sentiments except through his heels,
and these were now all too fully occupied in
their battle with the mud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>By this time the black mule had become absolutely
convinced that his fate was in the hands
of his ginger-haired driver. Jimmy Wright,
as it seemed to him, was his sole protection
against this violent horror which kept bursting
and crashing on every hand about him. It
was clear to him that Jimmy Wright, though
apparently much annoyed, was not afraid.
Therefore, with Jimmy Wright as his protector
he was safe. He wagged his ears, snorted
contemptuously at a 5.9 which spurted up a
column of mud and smoke some hundred yards
to the left, and plodded on gamely through the
mud. He didn&rsquo;t know where he was going,
but Jimmy Wright was there, and just ahead
of his nose, where he could sniff at him; and he
felt sure there would be fodder and a rub down
at the end of the weary road.</p>
<p>In the midst of these consoling reflections
something startling and inexplicable happened.
He was enveloped and swept away in a deafening
roar. Thick blackness, streaked with
star-showers, blinded him. Though half-stupefied,
he kicked and struggled with all his
strength, for it was not in him to yield himself,
like a stricken horse, to any stroke of Fate.</p>
<p>When he once more saw daylight, he was
recovering his feet just below the rim of an old
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
shell-hole. He gained the top, braced his legs,
and shook himself vigorously. The loaded
panniers thumping heavily upon his ribs restored
him fully to his senses. Snorting
through wide red nostrils, he stared about him
wildly. Some ten paces distant he saw a great
new crater in the mud, reeking with black and
orange fumes.</p>
<p>But where was Jimmy Wright? The mule
swept anxious eyes across the waste of shell-holes,
in every direction. In vain. His master
had vanished. He felt himself deserted.
Panic began to clutch at his heart, and he gathered
his muscles for frantic flight. And then
he recovered himself and stood steady. He had
caught sight of a ginger-haired head, bare of
its shrapnel helmet, lying on the mud at the
other side of the shell-hole from which he had
just struggled out.</p>
<p>His panic passed at once, but it gave place
to anxious wonder. There, indeed, was Jimmy
Wright, but what was he doing there? His
body was buried almost to the shoulders in the
discoloured slime that half filled the shell-hole.
He was lying on his face. His arms were outstretched,
and his hands were clutching at the
slippery walls of the hole as if he were striving
to pull himself up from the water. This effort,
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
however, seemed anything but successful. The
mule saw, indeed, that his protector was slowly
slipping deeper into the slime. This filled him
with fresh alarm. If Jimmy Wright should
disappear under that foul surface, that would
be desertion complete and final. It was not
to be endured.</p>
<p>Quickly but cautiously the mule picked his
way around the hole, and then, with sagacious
bracing of his hoofs, down to his master&rsquo;s side.
But what was to be done next? Jimmy
Wright&rsquo;s face was turned so that he could not
see his would-be rescuer. His hands were still
clutching at the mud, but feebly and without
effect.</p>
<p>The mule saw that his master was on the
point of vanishing under the mud, of deserting
him in his extremity. This was intolerable.
The emergency quickened his wits. Instinct
suggested to him that to keep a thing one should
take hold of it and hold on to it. He reached
down with his big yellow teeth, took hold of
the shoulder of Jimmy Wright&rsquo;s tunic, and held
on. Unfamiliar with anatomy, he at the same
time took hold of a substantial portion of
Jimmy Wright&rsquo;s own shoulder inside the tunic,
and held on to that. He braced himself, and
with a loud, involuntary snort began to pull.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>Jimmy Wright, up to this point, had been no
more than half conscious. The mule&rsquo;s teeth
in his shoulder revived him effectually. He
came to himself with a yell. He remembered
the shell-burst. He saw and understood where
he was. He was afraid to move for a moment,
lest he should find that his shoulder was blown
off. But no, he had two arms, and he could
move them. He had his shoulder all right, for
something was pulling at it with quite sickening
energy. He reached up his right arm&mdash;it
was the left shoulder that was being tugged
at&mdash;and encountered the furry head and ears
of his rescuer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sonny!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be
d&mdash;&mdash;d!&rdquo; And he gripped fervently at the
mule&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>Reassured at the sound of his master&rsquo;s voice,
the big mule took his teeth out of Wright&rsquo;s
shoulder and began nuzzling solicitously at his
sandy head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, old man,&rdquo; said the New
Brunswicker, thinking quickly, while with his
left hand he secured a grip on the mule&rsquo;s headstall.
Then he strove to raise himself from
the slime. The effort produced no result,
except to send a wave of blackness across his
brain. Wondering sickly if he carried some
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
terrible injury concealed under the mud, he
made haste to pass the halter rope under his
arms and knot it beneath his chest. Then he
shouted for help, twice and again, till his voice
trailed off into a whimper and he relapsed into
unconsciousness. The mule shifted his feet to
gain a more secure foothold on the treacherous
slope, and then stood wagging his ears and
gazing down on Jimmy in benevolent content.
So long as Jimmy was with him, he felt that
things were bound to come all right. Jimmy
would presently get up and lead him out of the
shell-hole, and take him home.</p>
<p>Shell after shell, whining or thundering according
to their breed, soared high over the
hole, but the black mule only wagged his ears
at them. His eyes were anchored upon the
unconscious sandy head of Jimmy Wright.
Suddenly, however, a sharp voice made him
look up. He saw a couple of stretcher-bearers
standing on the edge of the shell-hole, looking
down sympathetically upon him and his charge.
In a second or two they were beside him, skilfully
and tenderly extricating Jimmy&rsquo;s body
from the mud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t gone west this time,&rdquo; pronounced
one, who had thrust an understanding hand
into the breast of the tunic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>Jimmy Wright opened his eyes wide suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not by a d&mdash;&mdash;d sight I ain&rsquo;t, Bill!&rdquo; he
muttered rather thickly. Then, his wits and
his voice coming clearer, he added: &ldquo;But if I
ain&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s thanks to this here old &mdash;&mdash; of an
Argentino mule, that come down into this hole
and yanked me out o&rsquo; the mud, and saved me.
Eh, Sonny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big mule was crowding up so close to
him as to somewhat incommode the two men
in their task on that treacherous incline. But
they warded off his inconvenient attentions
very gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s some mule, all right,&rdquo; grunted one of
the bearers, as they got Jimmy on to the
stretcher and laboriously climbed from the
shell-hole.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<h2 id="c10">STRIPES THE UNCONCERNED</h2>
<p>On the edge of evening, when the last of
the light was gathered in the pale-green
upper sky, and all the world of the quiet backwoods
clearings was sunken in a soft violet
dusk, a leisurely and self-possessed little animal
came strolling among the ancient stumps
and mossy hillocks of the open upland sheep-pasture.
He was about the size of an average
cat, but shorter of leg, with a long, sharp-muzzled
head, and he carried his broad feathery
tail very high in a graceful arch, like a
squirrel in good humour. Unlike most other
creatures of the wild, his colouring was such
as to make him conspicuous rather than to conceal
him. He was black, with a white stripe
down his face, a white patch on the back of his
neck, and a white stripe all the way along each
side of his body. And, also, unlike the rest of
the furtive folk, he seemed quite unconcerned
to hide his movements from observation.
Neither was he for ever glancing this way and
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
that, as if on the watch for enemies. Rather
he had the air of being content that his enemies
should do the watching&mdash;and avoid him.</p>
<p>The skunk&mdash;for such was the undignified
appellation of this very dignified personality
of the wilderness&mdash;was pleasantly engrossed
in his own business. That business, at the
moment, consisted in catching the big, fat,
juicy, copper-brown &ldquo;June-bugs&rdquo; as they
emerged from their holes in the sod, crawled
up the bending grass-stems, and spread their
wings for their heavy evening flight. It was
easy hunting, and he had no need of haste. To
snap up these great, slow and clumsy beetles as
they clung upon the grass-stems was as easy
as picking strawberries, and, indeed, not altogether
dissimilar, as he would nip off the hard,
glossy wing-cases of the big beetles as one nips
off the hull of the berry before munching the
succulent morsel.</p>
<p>Having slept the day through in his snug
burrow, in the underbrush which fringed the
forest edge of the clearing, he had come forth
into the dewy twilight equipped with a fine
appetite. He had come with the definite purpose
of hunting &ldquo;June-bugs,&rdquo; this being the
season, all too brief, for that highly-flavoured
delicacy. At first he had thought of nothing
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
else; but when he had taken the edge off his
hunger, he began to consider the chances of
varying his diet. As he seized an unlucky
beetle, close to the edge of a flat, spreading
juniper bush, a brooding ground-sparrow flew
up, with a startled <i>cheep</i>, from under his very
nose. He dropped the beetle and made a lightning
pounce at the bird. But her wing had
flicked him across the eyes, confusingly, and
he missed her. He knew well enough, however,
what her presence there among the warm
grass-tussocks meant. He went nosing eagerly
under the juniper bush, and soon found a nest
with four little brown-mottled eggs in it.
Tiny though they were, they made a tit-bit very
much to his taste, all the more so that they were
very near hatching. Having licked his jaws
and fastidiously polished the fur of his shrewd,
keen face, he sauntered off to see what other
delicacies the evening might have in store for
him.</p>
<p>A little further on, toward the centre of the
pasture, he came upon a flat slab of rock, its
surface sloping toward the south, its southward
edge slightly overhanging and fringed with
soft grass. He knew the rock well&mdash;knew
how its bare surface drank in the summer sun
all day long, and held the warmth throughout
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
the dew-chill nights. He knew, too, that other
creatures besides himself might very well appreciate
this genial warmth. Stealthily, and
without the smallest disturbance of the grassy
fringe, he sniffed along the overhanging edge
of the rock. Suddenly he stiffened, and his
sharp nose darted in under the rock. Then he
jerked back, with the writhing tail of a snake
between his jaws.</p>
<p>The prize was a big black-and-yellow garter
snake, not far from three feet long,&mdash;not venomous,
but full of energy and fight. It tried
to cling to its hiding-place; but the shrewd
skunk, instead of attempting to pull it out
straight, like a cork from a bottle neck, ran
forward a pace or two, and, as it were, &ldquo;peeled&rdquo;
it forth. It doubled out, struck him smartly
in the face with its harmless fangs, and then
coiled itself about his neck and forelegs.
There was a moment of confused rough-and-tumble,
but the skunk knew just how to handle
this kind of antagonist. Having bitten the
reptile&rsquo;s tail clean through, he presently, with
the help of his practised little jaws, succeeded
in getting hold of it by the back, an inch or
two behind the head. This ended the affair,
as a struggle, and the victor proceeded to round
off his supper on snake. He managed to put
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
away almost all but the head and tail, and then,
after a meticulous toilet to fur and paws&mdash;for
he was as fastidiously cleanly as a cat&mdash;he
sauntered back toward his burrow in the underbrush,
to refresh himself with a nap before
seeking further adventures.</p>
<p>Directly in his path stood three or four
young seedling firs, about two feet high, in a
dense cluster. Half a dozen paces beyond this
tiny thicket a big red fox, belly to earth, was
soundlessly stalking some quarry, perhaps a
mouse, which could be heard ever so faintly
rustling the grass-stems at the edge of the
thicket. To the skunk, with his well-filled
belly, the sound had no interest. He rounded
the thicket and came face to face with the fox.</p>
<p>Neither in size, strength, nor agility was he
any match for the savage red beast which stood
in his path, and was quite capable, indeed, of
dispatching him in two snaps of his long, lean
jaws. But he was not in the least put out.
Watchful, but cool, he kept straight on, neither
delaying nor hastening his leisurely and nonchalant
progress. The fox, on the other hand,
stopped short. He was hungry. His hunting
was interfered with, for that rustling under
the fir-branches had stopped. His fine red
brush twitched angrily. Nevertheless, he had
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
no stomach to tackle this easy-going little gentleman
in the black-and-white stripes. Showing
his long white teeth in a vindictive but
noiseless snarl, he stepped aside. And the
skunk, glancing back with bright eyes of vigilance
and understanding, passed on as if the
twilight world belonged to him. He knew&mdash;and
he knew his enemy knew as well&mdash;that he
carried with him a concealed weapon of such
potency that no fox, unless afflicted with madness,
would ever willingly run up against it.</p>
<p>Reaching his burrow in the underbrush without
further adventure, he found it empty. His
mate and her young ones&mdash;now three-quarters
grown&mdash;were scattered away foraging
for themselves over the wide, forest-scented
clearings. It was a spacious burrow, dug by
a sturdy, surly old woodchuck, who, though
usually as pugnacious as a badger and an obstinate
stickler for his rights, had in this case
yielded without a fight to the mild-mannered
little usurper, and humped off in disgust to
hollow a new abode much deeper in the forest,
where such a mischance would not be likely
to happen him again. Under the tenancy of
the skunk family the burrow was sweet and
dry and daintily kept. With a little grumble
of content deep in his throat he curled himself
up and went to sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>When he woke and set forth again to renew
his foraging, although he had only slept an
hour, his vigorous digestion had quite restored
his appetite. He had no more thought for
June-bugs. He wanted bigger game, more
red-blooded and with some excitement in it.
He thought of the farmyard, half a mile away
across the clearings, down over the round of
the upland. It was weeks now since he had
visited it. There might be something worth
picking up. There might be a mother hen with
chickens, in a pen which he could find a way
into. There might be a hen sitting on her
clutch of eggs in a stolen nest under the barn.
He had discovered in previous seasons that
most sitting hens had their nests provided for
them in secure places which he could in no way
manage to come at. But he had also found
that sometimes a foolish and secretive&mdash;and
very young&mdash;hen will <i>hide</i> her nest in some
such out-of-the-way place as under the barn
floor, where the troublesome human creatures
who preside over the destinies of hens cannot
get at it. Here she keeps her precious eggs
all to herself till she has enough to cover comfortably,
and then she proceeds to the pleasant
task of brooding them, and has things all her
own way till some night-prowler comes along
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
and convicts her, finally and fatally, of her
folly.</p>
<p>A full moon, large and ruddy like a ripe
pumpkin, was just rising behind the jagged
black tops of the spruce forest. It threw long,
fantastic, confusing shadows across the dewy
hillocks of the pasture. Hither and thither,
in and out and across the barred streaks of
light, darted the wild rabbits, gambolling as
if half beside themselves, as if smitten with a
midsummer madness by the capricious magic
of the night. But if mad, they retained enough
sound sense to keep ever at a prudent distance
from the leisurely striped wayfarer who appeared
so little interested in their sport.
Though they were bigger than he, they knew
that, if they should venture within reach of his
pounce, his indifference would vanish and his
inexorable fangs would be in their throats.</p>
<p>Knowing his utter inability to compete with
the speed of the rabbits, now they were wide
awake, the skunk hardly noticed their antics,
but kept on his direct path toward the farmyard.
Presently, however, his attention was
caught by the rabbits scattering off in every
direction. On the instant he was all alert for
the cause. Mounting a hillock, he caught sight
of a biggish shaggy-haired dog some distance
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
down the pasture. The dog was racing this
way and that as crazily, it seemed, as the rabbits,
with faint little yelps of excitement and
whines of disappointment. He was chasing
the rabbits with all his energy; and it was evident
that he was a stranger, a new-comer to
the wilderness world, for he seemed to think
he might hope to catch the fleet-foot creatures
by merely running after them. As a matter
of fact, he had just arrived that same day at
the backwoods farm from the city down the
river. His experience had been confined to
streets and gardens and the chasing of cats,
and he was daft with delight over the spacious
freedom of the clearings. The skunk eyed
him scornfully, and continued his journey with
the unconcern of an elephant.</p>
<p>A moment later the dog was aware of a little,
insignificant black-and-white creature coming
slowly towards him as if unconscious of his
presence. Another rabbit! But as this one
did not seem alarmed, he stopped and eyed it
with surprise, his head cocked to one side in
inquiry. The skunk half turned and moved
off slowly, deliberately, at right angles to the
path he had been following.</p>
<p>With a yelp of delight the dog dashed at this
easy victim, which seemed so stupid that it
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
made no effort to escape. He was almost upon
it. Another leap and he would have had it in
his jaws. But the amazing little animal turned
its back on him, stuck its tail straight in the
air, and jerked up its hindquarters with a derisive
gesture. In that instant something hot
and soft struck the inexperienced hunter full
in the face&mdash;something soft, indeed, but overwhelming,
paralyzing. It stopped him dead in
his tracks. Suffocating, intolerably pungent,
it both blinded him and choked him. His lungs
refused to work, shutting up spasmodically.
Gasping and gagging, he grovelled on his belly
and strove frantically to paw his mouth and
nostrils clear of the dense, viscous fluid which
was clogging them. Failing in this, he fell to
rooting violently in the short grass, biting and
tearing at it and rolling in it, till some measure
of breath and eyesight returned to him.
Thereupon, his matted head all stuck with grass
and moss and dirt, he set off racing madly for
the farm-house, where he expected to get relief
from the strange torment which afflicted him.
But when he pawed and whined at the
kitchen door for admittance, he was driven
off with contumely and broomsticks. There
was nothing for him to do but slink away with
his shame to a secluded corner between the
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
wagon-shed and the pig-pen, where he could
soothe his burning muzzle in the cool winds and
fresh earth. On the following day one of the
farm hands, with rude hands and unsympathetic
comment, scrubbed him violently with
liquid soap and then clipped close his splendid
shaggy coat. But it was a week before he was
readmitted to the comfortable fellowship of
the farmhouse kitchen.</p>
<p>For a moment or two, with a glance of triumph
in his bright eyes, the skunk had watched
the paroxysms of his discomfited foe. Then,
dropping the tip of his tail into its customary
disdainful arch, he had turned back towards
his burrow. This was a redoubtable foe whom
he had just put to rout, and he had expended
most of his armoury upon him. He had no
wish to risk another encounter until the potent
secretion which he carried in a sac between the
powerful muscles of his thighs should have had
time to accumulate again. He dropped, for
that night, all notion of the distinctly adventurous
expedition to the farmyard, contenting
himself with snapping up a few beetles and
crickets as he went. He was lucky enough to
pounce upon an indiscreet field-mouse just as
she emerged from her burrow, and then a few
minutes&rsquo; digging with his powerful and expert
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
fore-paws had served to unearth the mouse&rsquo;s
nest with her half-dozen tiny blind sucklings.
So he went home well satisfied with himself.
Before re-entering he again made a careful
toilet; and as the opening of the sac from which
he had projected the potent fluid into his
enemy&rsquo;s face had immediately closed up tight
and fast, he carried no trace of the virulent
odour with him. Indeed, that fluid was a
thing which he never by any chance allowed
to get on to his own fur. Always, at the
moment of ejecting it, the fur on his thighs
parted and lay back flat to either side of the
naked vent of the sac, and the long tail cocked
itself up rigidly, well out of the way. It was
a stuff he kept strictly for his foes, and never
allowed to offend either himself or his friends.</p>
<p>On entering his burrow he found there his
mate and all the youngsters, curled up together
in the sleep of good digestion and easy conscience.
He curled himself up with them, that
the supply of his high-explosive might accumulate
during another forty winks.</p>
<p>About an hour before the dawn he awoke
again, feeling hungry. The rest of the family
were still sleeping, having gorged themselves,
as he might have done had it not been for that
encounter with the misguided dog. He left
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
them whimpering contentedly in their cosy
slumber, and crept forth into the dewy chill
alone, his heart set on mice and such-like warm-blooded
game.</p>
<p>The moon was now high overhead, sailing
honey-coloured through a faintly violet sky.
The rough pasture, with its stumps and hillocks,
was touched into a land of dream.</p>
<p>Now, it chanced that an old bear, who was
accustomed to foraging in the valley beyond
the cedar swamp, had on this night decided to
bring her cub on an expedition toward the more
dangerous neighbourhood of the clearings.
She wanted to begin his education in all the
wariness which is so necessary for the creatures
of the wild in approaching the works and
haunts of man. On reaching the leafy fringe
of bushes which fringed the rude rail-fence
dividing the forest from the pasture, she cautiously
poked her head through the leafage,
and for perhaps a minute, motionless as a stone,
she interrogated the bright open spaces with
eyes and ears and nostrils. The cub, taking
the cue from his mother, stiffened to the like
movelessness at her side, his bright little eyes
full of interest and curiosity. There was no
sign of danger in the pasture. In fact, there
were the merry rabbits hopping about in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
moonlight undisturbed. This was a sign of
security quite good enough for the wise old
bear. With crafty and experienced paws she
forced a hole in the fence&mdash;leaving the top
rail, above the binder, in its place&mdash;and led
the eager cub forth into the moonlight.</p>
<p>The special notion of the bear in coming to
the pasture was to teach her cub the art of
finding, unearthing, and catching the toothsome
wild mice. Keeping along near the
fence, she sniffed the tussocky, uneven grass
with practised nose. But the first thing she
came upon was a bumble-bees&rsquo; nest. This was
far more to her taste than any mice. She gave
a low call to the cub; but the cub was preoccupied
now, sniffing at the rabbit tracks, and lifting
himself on his hindquarters to stare longingly
at the rabbits, who were hopping off to
discreeter distance. The mother did not insist
on his coming to watch her tackle the bees&rsquo; nest.
After all, he was perhaps a bit young to face
the stings of the angry bees, and she might as
well have the little hoard of honey and larv&aelig;
and bee-bread for herself. The cub wandered
off a little way, with some vague notion of
chasing the elusive rabbits.</p>
<p>Just then through the edge of the underbrush
appeared the skunk, stretching himself
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
luxuriously before he started off across the pasture.
He saw the bear, but he knew that
sagacious beast would pay him no attention
whatever. He trotted out into the moonlight
and pounced upon a fat black cricket as an
appetizer.</p>
<p>The cub caught sight of the pretty little
striped creature, and came darting clumsily
and gaily to the attack. He would show his
mother that he could do some hunting on his
own account. The striped creature turned its
back on him and moved off slowly. The cub
was delighted. He was just going to reach
out a rude little paw and grab the easy prize.
Then the inevitable happened. The pretty
striped creature gave its stern a contemptuous
jerk, and the deluded cub fell in a heap, squealing,
gasping, choking, and pawing convulsively
at the horrible sticky stuff which filled his
mouth and eyes.</p>
<p>Just before the catastrophe occurred, the old
bear had looked up from her business with the
bees, and had uttered a loud <i>woof</i> of warning.
But too late. The last thing in the world she
wanted to do was to try any fooling with a
skunk. But now her rage at the suffering and
discomfiture of her little one swept away all
prudence. With a grunt of fury she charged
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
at the offender. One glance at the approaching
vengeance convinced the skunk that this
time he had made a mistake. He turned and
raced for the underbrush as fast as his little
legs would carry him. But that was not fast
enough. Just as he was about to dart under
the fence, a huge black paw, shod with claws
like steel, crashed down upon him, and his
leisurely career came to an end.</p>
<p>The bear, in deep disgust, scraped her reeking
paw long and earnestly in the fresh earth
beneath the grass, then turned her attention
to the unhappy cub. She relieved her feelings
by giving him a sharp cuff which sent him
sprawling a dozen feet. Then, relenting, she
showed him how to clean himself by rooting in
the earth. At length, when he could see and
breathe once more with some degree of comfort,
she indignantly led him away back into
the depths of the consoling forest.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
